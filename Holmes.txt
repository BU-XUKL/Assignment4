2852	"Mr. Sherlock Holmes"
2852	""
2852	""
2852	"      Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings,"
2852	"      save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all"
2852	"      night, was seated at the breakfast table. I stood upon the"
2852	"      hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left"
2852	"      behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood,"
2852	"      bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a “Penang lawyer.”"
2852	"      Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch"
2852	"      across. “To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the"
2852	"      C.C.H.,” was engraved upon it, with the date “1884.” It was just"
2852	"      such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to"
2852	"      carry—dignified, solid, and reassuring."
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, Watson, what do you make of it?”"
2852	""
2852	"      Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no"
2852	"      sign of my occupation."
2852	""
2852	"      “How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in"
2852	"      the back of your head.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in"
2852	"      front of me,” said he. “But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of"
2852	"      our visitor’s stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss"
2852	"      him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir"
2852	"      becomes of importance. Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an"
2852	"      examination of it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I think,” said I, following as far as I could the methods of my"
2852	"      companion, “that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical"
2852	"      man, well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of"
2852	"      their appreciation.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Good!” said Holmes. “Excellent!”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a"
2852	"      country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on"
2852	"      foot.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Why so?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has"
2852	"      been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town"
2852	"      practitioner carrying it. The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so"
2852	"      it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with"
2852	"      it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Perfectly sound!” said Holmes."
2852	""
2852	"      “And then again, there is the ‘friends of the C.C.H.’ I should"
2852	"      guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose"
2852	"      members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which"
2852	"      has made him a small presentation in return.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Really, Watson, you excel yourself,” said Holmes, pushing back"
2852	"      his chair and lighting a cigarette. “I am bound to say that in"
2852	"      all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own"
2852	"      small achievements you have habitually underrated your own"
2852	"      abilities. It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you"
2852	"      are a conductor of light. Some people without possessing genius"
2852	"      have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my dear"
2852	"      fellow, that I am very much in your debt.”"
2852	""
2852	"      He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words"
2852	"      gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his"
2852	"      indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had"
2852	"      made to give publicity to his methods. I was proud, too, to think"
2852	"      that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way"
2852	"      which earned his approval. He now took the stick from my hands"
2852	"      and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then with"
2852	"      an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and"
2852	"      carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a"
2852	"      convex lens."
2852	""
2852	"      “Interesting, though elementary,” said he as he returned to his"
2852	"      favourite corner of the settee. “There are certainly one or two"
2852	"      indications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several"
2852	"      deductions.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Has anything escaped me?” I asked with some self-importance. “I"
2852	"      trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have"
2852	"      overlooked?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were"
2852	"      erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be"
2852	"      frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided"
2852	"      towards the truth. Not that you are entirely wrong in this"
2852	"      instance. The man is certainly a country practitioner. And he"
2852	"      walks a good deal.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Then I was right.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “To that extent.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But that was all.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, no, my dear Watson, not all—by no means all. I would"
2852	"      suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more"
2852	"      likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when"
2852	"      the initials ‘C.C.’ are placed before that hospital the words"
2852	"      ‘Charing Cross’ very naturally suggest themselves.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You may be right.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a"
2852	"      working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our"
2852	"      construction of this unknown visitor.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, then, supposing that ‘C.C.H.’ does stand for ‘Charing"
2852	"      Cross Hospital,’ what further inferences may we draw?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has"
2852	"      practised in town before going to the country.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look"
2852	"      at it in this light. On what occasion would it be most probable"
2852	"      that such a presentation would be made? When would his friends"
2852	"      unite to give him a pledge of their good will? Obviously at the"
2852	"      moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the"
2852	"      hospital in order to start a practice for himself. We know there"
2852	"      has been a presentation. We believe there has been a change from"
2852	"      a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then, stretching"
2852	"      our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the"
2852	"      occasion of the change?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It certainly seems probable.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the _staff_"
2852	"      of the hospital, since only a man well-established in a London"
2852	"      practice could hold such a position, and such a one would not"
2852	"      drift into the country. What was he, then? If he was in the"
2852	"      hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a"
2852	"      house-surgeon or a house-physician—little more than a senior"
2852	"      student. And he left five years ago—the date is on the stick. So"
2852	"      your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin"
2852	"      air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under"
2852	"      thirty, amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of"
2852	"      a favourite dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger"
2852	"      than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his"
2852	"      settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling."
2852	""
2852	"      “As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,” said I,"
2852	"      “but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars"
2852	"      about the man’s age and professional career.” From my small"
2852	"      medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up the"
2852	"      name. There were several Mortimers, but only one who could be our"
2852	"      visitor. I read his record aloud."
2852	""
2852	"        “Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon."
2852	"        House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital."
2852	"        Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology, with"
2852	"        essay entitled ‘Is Disease a Reversion?’  Corresponding member"
2852	"        of the Swedish Pathological Society.  Author of ‘Some Freaks of"
2852	"        Atavism’ (_Lancet_ 1882).  ‘Do We Progress?’ (_Journal of"
2852	"        Psychology_, March, 1883). Medical Officer for the parishes of"
2852	"        Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No mention of that local hunt, Watson,” said Holmes with a"
2852	"      mischievous smile, “but a country doctor, as you very astutely"
2852	"      observed. I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences. As"
2852	"      to the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable,"
2852	"      unambitious, and absent-minded. It is my experience that it is"
2852	"      only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials, only"
2852	"      an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country,"
2852	"      and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his"
2852	"      visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And the dog?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master."
2852	"      Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle,"
2852	"      and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible. The dog’s"
2852	"      jaw, as shown in the space between these marks, is too broad in"
2852	"      my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff. It"
2852	"      may have been—yes, by Jove, it _is_ a curly-haired spaniel.”"
2852	""
2852	"      He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the"
2852	"      recess of the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his"
2852	"      voice that I glanced up in surprise."
2852	""
2852	"      “My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our"
2852	"      very door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don’t move, I"
2852	"      beg you, Watson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your"
2852	"      presence may be of assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment"
2852	"      of fate, Watson, when you hear a step upon the stair which is"
2852	"      walking into your life, and you know not whether for good or ill."
2852	"      What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of science, ask of Sherlock"
2852	"      Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!”"
2852	""
2852	"      The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had"
2852	"      expected a typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin"
2852	"      man, with a long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two"
2852	"      keen, grey eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly from"
2852	"      behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a"
2852	"      professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was"
2852	"      dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long back was"
2852	"      already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head"
2852	"      and a general air of peering benevolence. As he entered his eyes"
2852	"      fell upon the stick in Holmes’s hand, and he ran towards it with"
2852	"      an exclamation of joy. “I am so very glad,” said he. “I was not"
2852	"      sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I"
2852	"      would not lose that stick for the world.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “A presentation, I see,” said Holmes."
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, sir.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “From Charing Cross Hospital?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Dear, dear, that’s bad!” said Holmes, shaking his head."
2852	""
2852	"      Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment."
2852	"      “Why was it bad?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your"
2852	"      marriage, you say?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all"
2852	"      hopes of a consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home"
2852	"      of my own.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,” said Holmes."
2852	"      “And now, Dr. James Mortimer—”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Mister, sir, Mister—a humble M.R.C.S.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And a man of precise mind, evidently.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the"
2852	"      shores of the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr."
2852	"      Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and not—”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, this is my friend Dr. Watson.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in"
2852	"      connection with that of your friend. You interest me very much,"
2852	"      Mr. Holmes. I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or"
2852	"      such well-marked supra-orbital development. Would you have any"
2852	"      objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure? A"
2852	"      cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available, would"
2852	"      be an ornament to any anthropological museum. It is not my"
2852	"      intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. “You are"
2852	"      an enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am"
2852	"      in mine,” said he. “I observe from your forefinger that you make"
2852	"      your own cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the"
2852	"      other with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers"
2852	"      as agile and restless as the antennæ of an insect."
2852	""
2852	"      Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the"
2852	"      interest which he took in our curious companion. “I presume,"
2852	"      sir,” said he at last, “that it was not merely for the purpose of"
2852	"      examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here"
2852	"      last night and again today?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of"
2852	"      doing that as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I"
2852	"      recognized that I am myself an unpractical man and because I am"
2852	"      suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary"
2852	"      problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you are the second highest"
2852	"      expert in Europe—”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?”"
2852	"      asked Holmes with some asperity."
2852	""
2852	"      “To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur"
2852	"      Bertillon must always appeal strongly.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Then had you not better consult him?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a"
2852	"      practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone."
2852	"      I trust, sir, that I have not inadvertently—”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Just a little,” said Holmes. “I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would"
2852	"      do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly"
2852	"      what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my"
2852	"      assistance.”"

2852	"The Curse of the Baskervilles"
2852	""
2852	""
2852	"      “I have in my pocket a manuscript,” said Dr. James Mortimer."
2852	""
2852	"      “I observed it as you entered the room,” said Holmes."
2852	""
2852	"      “It is an old manuscript.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “How can you say that, sir?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all"
2852	"      the time that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert"
2852	"      who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so."
2852	"      You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject."
2852	"      I put that at 1730.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “The exact date is 1742.” Dr. Mortimer drew it from his"
2852	"      breast-pocket. “This family paper was committed to my care by Sir"
2852	"      Charles Baskerville, whose sudden and tragic death some three"
2852	"      months ago created so much excitement in Devonshire. I may say"
2852	"      that I was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant."
2852	"      He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical, and as"
2852	"      unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this document very"
2852	"      seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did"
2852	"      eventually overtake him.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it"
2852	"      upon his knee. “You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of"
2852	"      the long _s_ and the short. It is one of several indications"
2852	"      which enabled me to fix the date.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded"
2852	"      script. At the head was written: “Baskerville Hall,” and below in"
2852	"      large, scrawling figures: “1742.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It appears to be a statement of some sort.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the"
2852	"      Baskerville family.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But I understand that it is something more modern and practical"
2852	"      upon which you wish to consult me?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be"
2852	"      decided within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and"
2852	"      is intimately connected with the affair. With your permission I"
2852	"      will read it to you.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together,"
2852	"      and closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer"
2852	"      turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking"
2852	"      voice the following curious, old-world narrative:"

2852	"            wicked companions, stole down upon the farm and carried off"
2852	"            the maiden, her father and brothers being from home, as he"
2852	"            well knew.  When they had brought her to the Hall the"

2852	"            friends sat down to a long carouse, as was their nightly"

2852	"            but at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy"

2852	"        has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate for"
2852	"        Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over the"
2852	"        county.  Though Sir Charles had resided at Baskerville Hall for"
2852	"        a comparatively short period his amiability of character and"
2852	"        extreme generosity had won the affection and respect of all who"
2852	"        had been brought into contact with him.  In these days of"
2852	"        _nouveaux riches_ it is refreshing to find a case where the"

2852	"        is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him"
2852	"        to restore the fallen grandeur of his line.  Sir Charles, as is"
2852	"        well known, made large sums of money in South African"
2852	"        speculation. More wise than those who go on until the wheel"
2852	"        turns against them, he realised his gains and returned to"
2852	"        England with them.  It is only two years since he took up his"
2852	"        residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common talk how large"
2852	"        were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which have"
2852	"        been interrupted by his death.  Being himself childless, it was"
2852	"        his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should,"
2852	"        within his own lifetime, profit by his good fortune, and many"
2852	"        will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end.  His"
2852	"        generous donations to local and county charities have been"

2852	"            those rumours to which local superstition has given rise."
2852	"            There is no reason whatever to suspect foul play, or to"

2852	"            Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to"
2852	"            have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind. In"
2852	"            spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his"

2852	"            show that Sir Charles’s health has for some time been"

2852	"            Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of the"
2852	"            deceased, has given evidence to the same effect."
2852	""
2852	"            “The facts of the case are simple.  Sir Charles Baskerville"
2852	"            was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking"
2852	"            down the famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall.  The"
2852	"            evidence of the Barrymores shows that this had been his"
2852	"            custom. On the fourth of May Sir Charles had declared his"
2852	"            intention of starting next day for London, and had ordered"
2852	"            Barrymore to prepare his luggage.  That night he went out"
2852	"            as usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he"
2852	"            was in the habit of smoking a cigar.  He never returned. "
2852	"            At twelve o’clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still"
2852	"            open, became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went in"
2852	"            search of his master.  The day had been wet, and Sir"
2852	"            Charles’s footmarks were easily traced down the alley. "
2852	"            Halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on"
2852	"            to the moor. There were indications that Sir Charles had"
2852	"            stood for some little time here.  He then proceeded down"
2852	"            the alley, and it was at the far end of it that his body"
2852	"            was discovered. One fact which has not been explained is"
2852	"            the statement of Barrymore that his master’s footprints"
2852	"            altered their character from the time that he passed the"
2852	"            moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onward to have"
2852	"            been walking upon his toes.  One Murphy, a gipsy"
2852	"            horse-dealer, was on the moor at no great distance at the"
2852	"            time, but he appears by his own confession to have been the"
2852	"            worse for drink. He declares that he heard cries but is"
2852	"            unable to state from what direction they came.  No signs of"
2852	"            violence were to be discovered upon Sir Charles’s person,"
2852	"            and though the doctor’s evidence pointed to an almost"
2852	"            incredible facial distortion—so great that Dr. Mortimer"
2852	"            refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend"
2852	"            and patient who lay before him—it was explained that that"
2852	"            is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspnœa and"
2852	"            death from cardiac exhaustion.  This explanation was borne"
2852	"            out by the post-mortem examination, which showed"
2852	"            long-standing organic disease, and the coroner’s jury"
2852	"            returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence."
2852	"             It is well that this is so, for it is obviously of the"

2852	"      expression."
2852	""
2852	"      “In doing so,” said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of"
2852	"      some strong emotion, “I am telling that which I have not confided"
2852	"      to anyone. My motive for withholding it from the coroner’s"
2852	"      inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing himself in"
2852	"      the public position of seeming to indorse a popular superstition."
2852	"      I had the further motive that Baskerville Hall, as the paper"
2852	"      says, would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to"
2852	"      increase its already rather grim reputation. For both these"
2852	"      reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less"
2852	"      than I knew, since no practical good could result from it, but"
2852	"      with you there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank."
2852	""
2852	"      “The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near"
2852	"      each other are thrown very much together. For this reason I saw a"
2852	"      good deal of Sir Charles Baskerville. With the exception of Mr."
2852	"      Frankland, of Lafter Hall, and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist,"
2852	"      there are no other men of education within many miles. Sir"
2852	"      Charles was a retiring man, but the chance of his illness brought"
2852	"      us together, and a community of interests in science kept us so."
2852	"      He had brought back much scientific information from South"
2852	"      Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together"
2852	"      discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the"
2852	"      Hottentot."
2852	""
2852	"      “Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me"
2852	"      that Sir Charles’s nervous system was strained to the breaking"
2852	"      point. He had taken this legend which I have read you exceedingly"
2852	"      to heart—so much so that, although he would walk in his own"
2852	"      grounds, nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at"
2852	"      night. Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr. Holmes, he was"
2852	"      honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family, and"
2852	"      certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors"
2852	"      were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly presence"
2852	"      constantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has"
2852	"      asked me whether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen"
2852	"      any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound. The latter"
2852	"      question he put to me several times, and always with a voice"
2852	"      which vibrated with excitement."
2852	""
2852	"      “I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some"
2852	"      three weeks before the fatal event. He chanced to be at his hall"
2852	"      door. I had descended from my gig and was standing in front of"
2852	"      him, when I saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and"
2852	"      stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror. I"
2852	"      whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something"
2852	"      which I took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the"
2852	"      drive. So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to go"
2852	"      down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for"
2852	"      it. It was gone, however, and the incident appeared to make the"
2852	"      worst impression upon his mind. I stayed with him all the"
2852	"      evening, and it was on that occasion, to explain the emotion"
2852	"      which he had shown, that he confided to my keeping that narrative"
2852	"      which I read to you when first I came. I mention this small"
2852	"      episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy"
2852	"      which followed, but I was convinced at the time that the matter"
2852	"      was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no"
2852	"      justification."

2852	"      “It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London."
2852	"      His heart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in"
2852	"      which he lived, however chimerical the cause of it might be, was"
2852	"      evidently having a serious effect upon his health. I thought that"
2852	"      a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a"
2852	"      new man. Mr. Stapleton, a mutual friend who was much concerned at"
2852	"      his state of health, was of the same opinion. At the last instant"
2852	"      came this terrible catastrophe."
2852	""
2852	"      “On the night of Sir Charles’s death Barrymore the butler, who"

2852	"      within an hour of the event. I checked and corroborated all the"
2852	"      facts which were mentioned at the inquest. I followed the"
2852	"      footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the spot at the moor-gate"
2852	"      where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the change in the"
2852	"      shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no"

2852	"      finally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched"
2852	"      until my arrival. Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his"

2852	"      strong emotion to such an extent that I could hardly have sworn"
2852	"      to his identity. There was certainly no physical injury of any"
2852	"      kind. But one false statement was made by Barrymore at the"
2852	"      inquest. He said that there were no traces upon the ground round"
2852	"      the body. He did not observe any. But I did—some little distance"

2852	"      one of them a hard-headed countryman, one a farrier, and one a"
2852	"      moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of this dreadful"

2852	""

2852	"      “I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But"
2852	"      now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why"

2852	"      breath that it is useless to investigate Sir Charles’s death, and"
2852	"      that you desire me to do it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I did not say that I desired you to do it.”"
2852	""

2852	"      at his watch—“in exactly one hour and a quarter.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He being the heir?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young"
2852	"      gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada. From the"
2852	"      accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every"
2852	"      way. I speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and"
2852	"      executor of Sir Charles’s will.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “There is no other claimant, I presume?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was"
2852	"      Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor"
2852	"      Sir Charles was the elder. The second brother, who died young, is"
2852	"      the father of this lad Henry. The third, Rodger, was the black"
2852	"      sheep of the family. He came of the old masterful Baskerville"
2852	"      strain and was the very image, they tell me, of the family"
2852	"      picture of old Hugo. He made England too hot to hold him, fled to"
2852	"      Central America, and died there in 1876 of yellow fever. Henry is"
2852	"      the last of the Baskervilles. In one hour and five minutes I meet"
2852	"      him at Waterloo Station. I have had a wire that he arrived at"
2852	"      Southampton this morning. Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you advise"
2852	"      me to do with him?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every"
2852	"      Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure"
2852	"      that if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he"
2852	"      would have warned me against bringing this, the last of the old"
2852	"      race, and the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place. And yet"
2852	"      it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak"
2852	"      countryside depends upon his presence. All the good work which"
2852	"      has been done by Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is"
2852	"      no tenant of the Hall. I fear lest I should be swayed too much by"
2852	"      my own obvious interest in the matter, and that is why I bring"
2852	"      the case before you and ask for your advice.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Holmes considered for a little time."
2852	""
2852	"      “Put into plain words, the matter is this,” said he. “In your"
2852	"      opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an"
2852	"      unsafe abode for a Baskerville—that is your opinion?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “At least I might go the length of saying that there is some"
2852	"      evidence that this may be so.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it"
2852	"      could work the young man evil in London as easily as in"
2852	"      Devonshire. A devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry"
2852	"      would be too inconceivable a thing.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would"
2852	"      probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these"
2852	"      things. Your advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young"
2852	"      man will be as safe in Devonshire as in London. He comes in fifty"
2852	"      minutes. What would you recommend?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who"
2852	"      is scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet"
2852	"      Sir Henry Baskerville.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And then?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up"
2852	"      my mind about the matter.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “How long will it take you to make up your mind?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Twenty-four hours. At ten o’clock tomorrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will"
2852	"      be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will"
2852	"      be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir"
2852	"      Henry Baskerville with you.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I will do so, Mr. Holmes.” He scribbled the appointment on his"

2852	"      fashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair."
2852	""
2852	"      “Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir"

2852	"      “Thank you. Good-morning.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward"
2852	"      satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him."
2852	""
2852	"      “Going out, Watson?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Unless I can help you.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to"
2852	"      you for aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points"
2852	"      of view. When you pass Bradley’s, would you ask him to send up a"
2852	"      pound of the strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as"
2852	"      well if you could make it convenient not to return before"
2852	"      evening. Then I should be very glad to compare impressions as to"
2852	"      this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this"
2852	"      morning.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my"
2852	"      friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during"
2852	"      which he weighed every particle of evidence, constructed"
2852	"      alternative theories, balanced one against the other, and made up"
2852	"      his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial."
2852	"      I therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to Baker"
2852	"      Street until evening. It was nearly nine o’clock when I found"
2852	"      myself in the sitting-room once more."
2852	""
2852	"      My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had"
2852	"      broken out, for the room was so filled with smoke that the light"
2852	"      of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it. As I entered,"
2852	"      however, my fears were set at rest, for it was the acrid fumes of"
2852	"      strong coarse tobacco which took me by the throat and set me"
2852	"      coughing. Through the haze I had a vague vision of Holmes in his"
2852	"      dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay pipe"
2852	"      between his lips. Several rolls of paper lay around him."
2852	""
2852	"      “Caught cold, Watson?” said he."
2852	""
2852	"      “No, it’s this poisonous atmosphere.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I suppose it _is_ pretty thick, now that you mention it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Thick! It is intolerable.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Open the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I"
2852	"      perceive.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “My dear Holmes!”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Am I right?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Certainly, but how?”"
2852	""
2852	"      He laughed at my bewildered expression. “There is a delightful"
2852	"      freshness about you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure to"
2852	"      exercise any small powers which I possess at your expense. A"
2852	"      gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day. He returns"
2852	"      immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his"
2852	"      boots. He has been a fixture therefore all day. He is not a man"
2852	"      with intimate friends. Where, then, could he have been? Is it not"
2852	"      obvious?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, it is rather obvious.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance"
2852	"      ever observes. Where do you think that I have been?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “A fixture also.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “In spirit?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Exactly. My body has remained in this armchair and has, I regret"
2852	"      to observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and"
2852	"      an incredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to"
2852	"      Stamford’s for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and"
2852	"      my spirit has hovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I"
2852	"      could find my way about.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “A large-scale map, I presume?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Very large.”"
2852	""
2852	"      He unrolled one section and held it over his knee. “Here you have"
2852	"      the particular district which concerns us. That is Baskerville"
2852	"      Hall in the middle.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “With a wood round it?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Exactly. I fancy the yew alley, though not marked under that"
2852	"      name, must stretch along this line, with the moor, as you"
2852	"      perceive, upon the right of it. This small clump of buildings"
2852	"      here is the hamlet of Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer has"
2852	"      his headquarters. Within a radius of five miles there are, as you"
2852	"      see, only a very few scattered dwellings. Here is Lafter Hall,"
2852	"      which was mentioned in the narrative. There is a house indicated"
2852	"      here which may be the residence of the naturalist—Stapleton, if I"
2852	"      remember right, was his name. Here are two moorland farmhouses,"
2852	"      High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles away the great convict"
2852	"      prison of Princetown. Between and around these scattered points"
2852	"      extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is the stage"
2852	"      upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may help to"
2852	"      play it again.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It must be a wild place.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to"
2852	"      have a hand in the affairs of men—”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural"
2852	"      explanation.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “The devil’s agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not?"
2852	"      There are two questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is"
2852	"      whether any crime has been committed at all; the second is, what"
2852	"      is the crime and how was it committed? Of course, if Dr."
2852	"      Mortimer’s surmise should be correct, and we are dealing with"
2852	"      forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature, there is an end of"
2852	"      our investigation. But we are bound to exhaust all other"
2852	"      hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I think we’ll shut"
2852	"      that window again, if you don’t mind. It is a singular thing, but"
2852	"      I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of"
2852	"      thought. I have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box"
2852	"      to think, but that is the logical outcome of my convictions. Have"
2852	"      you turned the case over in your mind?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “What do you make of it?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It is very bewildering.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It has certainly a character of its own. There are points of"
2852	"      distinction about it. That change in the footprints, for example."
2852	"      What do you make of that?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that"
2852	"      portion of the alley.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why"
2852	"      should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “What then?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He was running, Watson—running desperately, running for his"
2852	"      life, running until he burst his heart—and fell dead upon his"
2852	"      face.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Running from what?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was"
2852	"      crazed with fear before ever he began to run.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “How can you say that?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across"
2852	"      the moor. If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man"
2852	"      who had lost his wits would have run _from_ the house instead of"
2852	"      towards it. If the gipsy’s evidence may be taken as true, he ran"
2852	"      with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely"
2852	"      to be. Then, again, whom was he waiting for that night, and why"
2852	"      was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own"
2852	"      house?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You think that he was waiting for someone?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an"
2852	"      evening stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement."
2852	"      Is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes, as"
2852	"      Dr. Mortimer, with more practical sense than I should have given"
2852	"      him credit for, deduced from the cigar ash?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But he went out every evening.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every"
2852	"      evening. On the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the"
2852	"      moor. That night he waited there. It was the night before he made"
2852	"      his departure for London. The thing takes shape, Watson. It"
2852	"      becomes coherent. Might I ask you to hand me my violin, and we"
2852	"      will postpone all further thought upon this business until we"
2852	"      have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry"
2852	"      Baskerville in the morning.”"

2852	"Sir Henry Baskerville"
2852	""
2852	""
2852	"      Our breakfast table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his"
2852	"      dressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were"
2852	"      punctual to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten"
2852	"      when Dr. Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet."
2852	"      The latter was a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years"
2852	"      of age, very sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a"
2852	"      strong, pugnacious face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit and"
2852	"      had the weather-beaten appearance of one who has spent most of"
2852	"      his time in the open air, and yet there was something in his"
2852	"      steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated"
2852	"      the gentleman."
2852	""
2852	"      “This is Sir Henry Baskerville,” said Dr. Mortimer."
2852	""
2852	"      “Why, yes,” said he, “and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock"
2852	"      Holmes, that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to"
2852	"      you this morning I should have come on my own account. I"
2852	"      understand that you think out little puzzles, and I’ve had one"
2852	"      this morning which wants more thinking out than I am able to give"
2852	"      it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you"
2852	"      have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in"
2852	"      London?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as"
2852	"      not. It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which"
2852	"      reached me this morning.”"
2852	""
2852	"      He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It"
2852	"      was of common quality, greyish in colour. The address, “Sir Henry"
2852	"      Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel,” was printed in rough"
2852	"      characters; the post-mark “Charing Cross,” and the date of"
2852	"      posting the preceding evening."
2852	""
2852	"      “Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?” asked"
2852	"      Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor."
2852	""
2852	"      “No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr."
2852	"      Mortimer.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, I had been staying with a friend,” said the doctor."
2852	""
2852	"      “There was no possible indication that we intended to go to this"
2852	"      hotel.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your"
2852	"      movements.” Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap"
2852	"      paper folded into four. This he opened and spread flat upon the"
2852	"      table. Across the middle of it a single sentence had been formed"
2852	"      by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it. It ran:"
2852	""
2852	"        As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor."
2852	""
2852	"      The word “moor” only was printed in ink."
2852	""
2852	"      “Now,” said Sir Henry Baskerville, “perhaps you will tell me, Mr."
2852	"      Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is"
2852	"      that takes so much interest in my affairs?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there"
2852	"      is nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was"
2852	"      convinced that the business is supernatural.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “What business?” asked Sir Henry sharply. “It seems to me that"
2852	"      all you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own"
2852	"      affairs.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir"
2852	"      Henry. I promise you that,” said Sherlock Holmes. “We will"
2852	"      confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this"
2852	"      very interesting document, which must have been put together and"
2852	"      posted yesterday evening. Have you yesterday’s _Times_, Watson?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It is here in the corner.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Might I trouble you for it—the inside page, please, with the"
2852	"      leading articles?” He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes"
2852	"      up and down the columns. “Capital article this on free trade."
2852	"      Permit me to give you an extract from it."
2852	""
2852	"     ‘You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or"
2852	"     your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff, but"
2852	"     it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run"
2852	"     keep away wealth from the country, diminish the value of our"
2852	"     imports, and lower the general conditions of life in this island.’"
2852	""
2852	"      “What do you think of that, Watson?” cried Holmes in high glee,"
2852	"      rubbing his hands together with satisfaction. “Don’t you think"
2852	"      that is an admirable sentiment?”"
2852	""
2852	"      Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional"
2852	"      interest, and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark"
2852	"      eyes upon me."
2852	""
2852	"      “I don’t know much about the tariff and things of that kind,”"
2852	"      said he, “but it seems to me we’ve got a bit off the trail so far"
2852	"      as that note is concerned.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail,"
2852	"      Sir Henry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do,"
2852	"      but I fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of"
2852	"      this sentence.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, I confess that I see no connection.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection"
2852	"      that the one is extracted out of the other. ‘You,’ ‘your,’"
2852	"      ‘your,’ ‘life,’ ‘reason,’ ‘value,’ ‘keep away,’ ‘from the.’ Don’t"
2852	"      you see now whence these words have been taken?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “By thunder, you’re right! Well, if that isn’t smart!” cried Sir"
2852	"      Henry."
2852	""
2852	"      “If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that"
2852	"      ‘keep away’ and ‘from the’ are cut out in one piece.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, now—so it is!”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have"
2852	"      imagined,” said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement."
2852	"      “I could understand anyone saying that the words were from a"
2852	"      newspaper; but that you should name which, and add that it came"
2852	"      from the leading article, is really one of the most remarkable"
2852	"      things which I have ever known. How did you do it?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from"
2852	"      that of an Esquimau?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Most certainly.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But how?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Because that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious."
2852	"      The supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve,"
2852	"      the—”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally"
2852	"      obvious. There is as much difference to my eyes between the"
2852	"      leaded bourgeois type of a _Times_ article and the slovenly print"
2852	"      of an evening half-penny paper as there could be between your"
2852	"      negro and your Esquimau. The detection of types is one of the"
2852	"      most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in"
2852	"      crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I"
2852	"      confused the _Leeds Mercury_ with the _Western Morning News_. But"
2852	"      a _Times_ leader is entirely distinctive, and these words could"
2852	"      have been taken from nothing else. As it was done yesterday the"
2852	"      strong probability was that we should find the words in"
2852	"      yesterday’s issue.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes,” said Sir Henry"
2852	"      Baskerville, “someone cut out this message with a scissors—”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Nail-scissors,” said Holmes. “You can see that it was a very"
2852	"      short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips"
2852	"      over ‘keep away.’”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of"
2852	"      short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste—”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Gum,” said Holmes."
2852	""
2852	"      “With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word ‘moor’"
2852	"      should have been written?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Because he could not find it in print. The other words were all"
2852	"      simple and might be found in any issue, but ‘moor’ would be less"
2852	"      common.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything"
2852	"      else in this message, Mr. Holmes?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have"
2852	"      been taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is"
2852	"      printed in rough characters. But the _Times_ is a paper which is"
2852	"      seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated. We"
2852	"      may take it, therefore, that the letter was composed by an"
2852	"      educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one, and his"
2852	"      effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing"
2852	"      might be known, or come to be known, by you. Again, you will"
2852	"      observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line, but"
2852	"      that some are much higher than others. ‘Life,’ for example is"
2852	"      quite out of its proper place. That may point to carelessness or"
2852	"      it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter."
2852	"      On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the matter was"
2852	"      evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer of such"
2852	"      a letter would be careless. If he were in a hurry it opens up the"
2852	"      interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any"
2852	"      letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he"
2852	"      would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an interruption—and"
2852	"      from whom?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork,” said Dr."
2852	"      Mortimer."
2852	""
2852	"      “Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and"
2852	"      choose the most likely. It is the scientific use of the"
2852	"      imagination, but we have always some material basis on which to"
2852	"      start our speculation. Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt,"
2852	"      but I am almost certain that this address has been written in a"
2852	"      hotel.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “How in the world can you say that?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and"
2852	"      the ink have given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered"
2852	"      twice in a single word and has run dry three times in a short"
2852	"      address, showing that there was very little ink in the bottle."
2852	"      Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is seldom allowed to be in such"
2852	"      a state, and the combination of the two must be quite rare. But"
2852	"      you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where it is rare to get"
2852	"      anything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation in saying that"
2852	"      could we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels around"
2852	"      Charing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated _Times_"
2852	"      leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent"
2852	"      this singular message. Halloa! Halloa! What’s this?”"
2852	""
2852	"      He was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words"
2852	"      were pasted, holding it only an inch or two from his eyes."
2852	""
2852	"      “Well?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Nothing,” said he, throwing it down. “It is a blank half-sheet"
2852	"      of paper, without even a water-mark upon it. I think we have"
2852	"      drawn as much as we can from this curious letter; and now, Sir"
2852	"      Henry, has anything else of interest happened to you since you"
2852	"      have been in London?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Why, no, Mr. Holmes. I think not.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel,”"
2852	"      said our visitor. “Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch"
2852	"      me?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “We are coming to that. You have nothing else to report to us"
2852	"      before we go into this matter?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth"
2852	"      reporting.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Sir Henry smiled. “I don’t know much of British life yet, for I"
2852	"      have spent nearly all my time in the States and in Canada. But I"
2852	"      hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary"
2852	"      routine of life over here.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You have lost one of your boots?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “My dear sir,” cried Dr. Mortimer, “it is only mislaid. You will"
2852	"      find it when you return to the hotel. What is the use of"
2852	"      troubling Mr. Holmes with trifles of this kind?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Exactly,” said Holmes, “however foolish the incident may seem."
2852	"      You have lost one of your boots, you say?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door last"
2852	"      night, and there was only one in the morning. I could get no"
2852	"      sense out of the chap who cleans them. The worst of it is that I"
2852	"      only bought the pair last night in the Strand, and I have never"
2852	"      had them on.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “If you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be"
2852	"      cleaned?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “They were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was why I"
2852	"      put them out.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Then I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you"
2852	"      went out at once and bought a pair of boots?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round with"
2852	"      me. You see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the"
2852	"      part, and it may be that I have got a little careless in my ways"
2852	"      out West. Among other things I bought these brown boots—gave six"
2852	"      dollars for them—and had one stolen before ever I had them on my"
2852	"      feet.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It seems a singularly useless thing to steal,” said Sherlock"
2852	"      Holmes. “I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer’s belief that it"
2852	"      will not be long before the missing boot is found.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And, now, gentlemen,” said the baronet with decision, “it seems"
2852	"      to me that I have spoken quite enough about the little that I"
2852	"      know. It is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full"
2852	"      account of what we are all driving at.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Your request is a very reasonable one,” Holmes answered. “Dr."
2852	"      Mortimer, I think you could not do better than to tell your story"
2852	"      as you told it to us.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his"
2852	"      pocket and presented the whole case as he had done upon the"
2852	"      morning before. Sir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest"
2852	"      attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise."
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, I seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance,”"
2852	"      said he when the long narrative was finished. “Of course, I’ve"
2852	"      heard of the hound ever since I was in the nursery. It’s the pet"
2852	"      story of the family, though I never thought of taking it"
2852	"      seriously before. But as to my uncle’s death—well, it all seems"
2852	"      boiling up in my head, and I can’t get it clear yet. You don’t"
2852	"      seem quite to have made up your mind whether it’s a case for a"
2852	"      policeman or a clergyman.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Precisely.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And now there’s this affair of the letter to me at the hotel. I"
2852	"      suppose that fits into its place.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what"
2852	"      goes on upon the moor,” said Dr. Mortimer."
2852	""
2852	"      “And also,” said Holmes, “that someone is not ill-disposed"
2852	"      towards you, since they warn you of danger.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Or it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me"
2852	"      away.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, of course, that is possible also. I am very much indebted"
2852	"      to you, Dr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which"
2852	"      presents several interesting alternatives. But the practical"
2852	"      point which we now have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or"
2852	"      is not advisable for you to go to Baskerville Hall.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Why should I not go?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “There seems to be danger.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger"
2852	"      from human beings?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, that is what we have to find out.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in hell,"
2852	"      Mr. Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me"
2852	"      from going to the home of my own people, and you may take that to"
2852	"      be my final answer.” His dark brows knitted and his face flushed"
2852	"      to a dusky red as he spoke. It was evident that the fiery temper"
2852	"      of the Baskervilles was not extinct in this their last"
2852	"      representative. “Meanwhile,” said he, “I have hardly had time to"
2852	"      think over all that you have told me. It’s a big thing for a man"
2852	"      to have to understand and to decide at one sitting. I should like"
2852	"      to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind. Now, look"
2852	"      here, Mr. Holmes, it’s half-past eleven now and I am going back"
2852	"      right away to my hotel. Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson,"
2852	"      come round and lunch with us at two. I’ll be able to tell you"
2852	"      more clearly then how this thing strikes me.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Is that convenient to you, Watson?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Perfectly.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Then you may expect us. Shall I have a cab called?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I’d prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I’ll join you in a walk, with pleasure,” said his companion."
2852	""
2852	"      “Then we meet again at two o’clock. Au revoir, and good-morning!”"
2852	""
2852	"      We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang"
2852	"      of the front door. In an instant Holmes had changed from the"
2852	"      languid dreamer to the man of action."
2852	""
2852	"      “Your hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a moment to lose!” He"
2852	"      rushed into his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in a"
2852	"      few seconds in a frock-coat. We hurried together down the stairs"
2852	"      and into the street. Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still"
2852	"      visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of"
2852	"      Oxford Street."
2852	""
2852	"      “Shall I run on and stop them?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Not for the world, my dear Watson. I am perfectly satisfied with"
2852	"      your company if you will tolerate mine. Our friends are wise, for"
2852	"      it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk.”"
2852	""
2852	"      He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which"
2852	"      divided us by about half. Then, still keeping a hundred yards"
2852	"      behind, we followed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street."
2852	"      Once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window, upon"
2852	"      which Holmes did the same. An instant afterwards he gave a little"
2852	"      cry of satisfaction, and, following the direction of his eager"
2852	"      eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted"
2852	"      on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward"
2852	"      again."
2852	""
2852	"      “There’s our man, Watson! Come along! We’ll have a good look at"
2852	"      him, if we can do no more.”"
2852	""
2852	"      At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of"
2852	"      piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab."
2852	"      Instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed"
2852	"      to the driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street."
2852	"      Holmes looked eagerly round for another, but no empty one was in"
2852	"      sight. Then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the"
2852	"      traffic, but the start was too great, and already the cab was out"
2852	"      of sight."
2852	""
2852	"      “There now!” said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white"
2852	"      with vexation from the tide of vehicles. “Was ever such bad luck"
2852	"      and such bad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are an"
2852	"      honest man you will record this also and set it against my"
2852	"      successes!”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Who was the man?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I have not an idea.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “A spy?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville"
2852	"      has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in"
2852	"      town. How else could it be known so quickly that it was the"
2852	"      Northumberland Hotel which he had chosen? If they had followed"
2852	"      him the first day I argued that they would follow him also the"
2852	"      second. You may have observed that I twice strolled over to the"
2852	"      window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, I remember.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none."
2852	"      We are dealing with a clever man, Watson. This matter cuts very"
2852	"      deep, and though I have not finally made up my mind whether it is"
2852	"      a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I"
2852	"      am conscious always of power and design. When our friends left I"
2852	"      at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their"
2852	"      invisible attendant. So wily was he that he had not trusted"
2852	"      himself upon foot, but he had availed himself of a cab so that he"
2852	"      could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice."
2852	"      His method had the additional advantage that if they were to take"
2852	"      a cab he was all ready to follow them. It has, however, one"
2852	"      obvious disadvantage.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It puts him in the power of the cabman.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Exactly.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “What a pity we did not get the number!”"
2852	""
2852	"      “My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not"
2852	"      seriously imagine that I neglected to get the number? No. 2704 is"
2852	"      our man. But that is no use to us for the moment.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I fail to see how you could have done more.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “On observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked"
2852	"      in the other direction. I should then at my leisure have hired a"
2852	"      second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance, or,"
2852	"      better still, have driven to the Northumberland Hotel and waited"
2852	"      there. When our unknown had followed Baskerville home we should"
2852	"      have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and"
2852	"      seeing where he made for. As it is, by an indiscreet eagerness,"
2852	"      which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and"
2852	"      energy by our opponent, we have betrayed ourselves and lost our"
2852	"      man.”"
2852	""
2852	"      We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this"
2852	"      conversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long"
2852	"      vanished in front of us."
2852	""
2852	"      “There is no object in our following them,” said Holmes. “The"
2852	"      shadow has departed and will not return. We must see what further"
2852	"      cards we have in our hands and play them with decision. Could you"
2852	"      swear to that man’s face within the cab?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I could swear only to the beard.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And so could I—from which I gather that in all probability it"
2852	"      was a false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no"
2852	"      use for a beard save to conceal his features. Come in here,"
2852	"      Watson!”"
2852	""
2852	"      He turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he"
2852	"      was warmly greeted by the manager."
2852	""
2852	"      “Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in"
2852	"      which I had the good fortune to help you?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and perhaps"
2852	"      my life.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “My dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection,"
2852	"      Wilson, that you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, who"
2852	"      showed some ability during the investigation.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, sir, he is still with us.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Could you ring him up?—thank you! And I should be glad to have"
2852	"      change of this five-pound note.”"
2852	""
2852	"      A lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the"
2852	"      summons of the manager. He stood now gazing with great reverence"
2852	"      at the famous detective."
2852	""
2852	"      “Let me have the Hotel Directory,” said Holmes. “Thank you! Now,"
2852	"      Cartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all"
2852	"      in the immediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross. Do you see?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, sir.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You will visit each of these in turn.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, sir.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one"
2852	"      shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, sir.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of"
2852	"      yesterday. You will say that an important telegram has miscarried"
2852	"      and that you are looking for it. You understand?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, sir.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But what you are really looking for is the centre page of the"
2852	"      _Times_ with some holes cut in it with scissors. Here is a copy"
2852	"      of the _Times_. It is this page. You could easily recognize it,"
2852	"      could you not?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, sir.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “In each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter,"
2852	"      to whom also you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-three"
2852	"      shillings. You will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of"
2852	"      the twenty-three that the waste of the day before has been burned"

2852	"      paper and you will look for this page of the _Times_ among it."
2852	"      The odds are enormously against your finding it. There are ten"
2852	"      shillings over in case of emergencies. Let me have a report by"
2852	"      wire at Baker Street before evening. And now, Watson, it only"
2852	"      remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman,"
2852	"      No. 2704, and then we will drop into one of the Bond Street"
2852	"      picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the"
2852	"      hotel.”"

2852	"Three Broken Threads"
2852	""
2852	""
2852	"      Sherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of"
2852	"      detaching his mind at will. For two hours the strange business in"
2852	"      which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was"
2852	"      entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern Belgian masters."
2852	"      He would talk of nothing but art, of which he had the crudest"
2852	"      ideas, from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at"
2852	"      the Northumberland Hotel."
2852	""
2852	"      “Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you,” said the"
2852	"      clerk. “He asked me to show you up at once when you came.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Have you any objection to my looking at your register?” said"
2852	"      Holmes."
2852	""
2852	"      “Not in the least.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The book showed that two names had been added after that of"
2852	"      Baskerville. One was Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle;"
2852	"      the other Mrs. Oldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton."
2852	""
2852	"      “Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know,” said"
2852	"      Holmes to the porter. “A lawyer, is he not, grey-headed, and"
2852	"      walks with a limp?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, sir, this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active"
2852	"      gentleman, not older than yourself.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Surely you are mistaken about his trade?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, sir! he has used this hotel for many years, and he is very"
2852	"      well known to us.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Ah, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem to remember the"
2852	"      name. Excuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one friend"
2852	"      one finds another.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “She is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was once mayor of"
2852	"      Gloucester. She always comes to us when she is in town.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. We have"
2852	"      established a most important fact by these questions, Watson,” he"
2852	"      continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together. “We know"
2852	"      now that the people who are so interested in our friend have not"
2852	"      settled down in his own hotel. That means that while they are, as"
2852	"      we have seen, very anxious to watch him, they are equally anxious"
2852	"      that he should not see them. Now, this is a most suggestive"
2852	"      fact.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “What does it suggest?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It suggests—halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth is the"
2852	"      matter?”"
2852	""
2852	"      As we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir"
2852	"      Henry Baskerville himself. His face was flushed with anger, and"
2852	"      he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands. So furious was"
2852	"      he that he was hardly articulate, and when he did speak it was in"
2852	"      a much broader and more Western dialect than any which we had"
2852	"      heard from him in the morning."
2852	""
2852	"      “Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel,” he"
2852	"      cried. “They’ll find they’ve started in to monkey with the wrong"
2852	"      man unless they are careful. By thunder, if that chap can’t find"
2852	"      my missing boot there will be trouble. I can take a joke with the"
2852	"      best, Mr. Holmes, but they’ve got a bit over the mark this time.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Still looking for your boot?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, sir, and mean to find it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “So it was, sir. And now it’s an old black one.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “What! you don’t mean to say—?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That’s just what I do mean to say. I only had three pairs in the"
2852	"      world—the new brown, the old black, and the patent leathers,"
2852	"      which I am wearing. Last night they took one of my brown ones,"
2852	"      and today they have sneaked one of the black. Well, have you got"
2852	"      it? Speak out, man, and don’t stand staring!”"
2852	""
2852	"      An agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene."
2852	""
2852	"      “No, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear"
2852	"      no word of it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, either that boot comes back before sundown or I’ll see the"
2852	"      manager and tell him that I go right straight out of this hotel.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It shall be found, sir—I promise you that if you will have a"
2852	"      little patience it will be found.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Mind it is, for it’s the last thing of mine that I’ll lose in"
2852	"      this den of thieves. Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you’ll excuse my"
2852	"      troubling you about such a trifle—”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I think it’s well worth troubling about.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Why, you look very serious over it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “How do you explain it?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I just don’t attempt to explain it. It seems the very maddest,"
2852	"      queerest thing that ever happened to me.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “The queerest perhaps—” said Holmes thoughtfully."
2852	""
2852	"      “What do you make of it yourself?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, I don’t profess to understand it yet. This case of yours"
2852	"      is very complex, Sir Henry. When taken in conjunction with your"
2852	"      uncle’s death I am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of"
2852	"      capital importance which I have handled there is one which cuts"
2852	"      so deep. But we hold several threads in our hands, and the odds"
2852	"      are that one or other of them guides us to the truth. We may"
2852	"      waste time in following the wrong one, but sooner or later we"
2852	"      must come upon the right.”"
2852	""
2852	"      We had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the"
2852	"      business which had brought us together. It was in the private"
2852	"      sitting-room to which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked"
2852	"      Baskerville what were his intentions."
2852	""
2852	"      “To go to Baskerville Hall.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And when?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “At the end of the week.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “On the whole,” said Holmes, “I think that your decision is a"
2852	"      wise one. I have ample evidence that you are being dogged in"
2852	"      London, and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult"
2852	"      to discover who these people are or what their object can be. If"
2852	"      their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief, and we"
2852	"      should be powerless to prevent it. You did not know, Dr."
2852	"      Mortimer, that you were followed this morning from my house?”"
2852	""
2852	"      Dr. Mortimer started violently. “Followed! By whom?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you. Have you among"
2852	"      your neighbours or acquaintances on Dartmoor any man with a"
2852	"      black, full beard?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No—or, let me see—why, yes. Barrymore, Sir Charles’s butler, is"
2852	"      a man with a full, black beard.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Ha! Where is Barrymore?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He is in charge of the Hall.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “We had best ascertain if he is really there, or if by any"
2852	"      possibility he might be in London.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “How can you do that?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Give me a telegraph form. ‘Is all ready for Sir Henry?’ That"
2852	"      will do. Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. What is the"
2852	"      nearest telegraph-office? Grimpen. Very good, we will send a"
2852	"      second wire to the postmaster, Grimpen: ‘Telegram to Mr."
2852	"      Barrymore to be delivered into his own hand. If absent, please"
2852	"      return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel.’ That"
2852	"      should let us know before evening whether Barrymore is at his"
2852	"      post in Devonshire or not.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That’s so,” said Baskerville. “By the way, Dr. Mortimer, who is"
2852	"      this Barrymore, anyhow?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. They have"
2852	"      looked after the Hall for four generations now. So far as I know,"
2852	"      he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the"
2852	"      county.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “At the same time,” said Baskerville, “it’s clear enough that so"
2852	"      long as there are none of the family at the Hall these people"
2852	"      have a mighty fine home and nothing to do.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That is true.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Did Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles’s will?” asked"
2852	"      Holmes."
2852	""
2852	"      “He and his wife had five hundred pounds each.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Ha! Did they know that they would receive this?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provisions"
2852	"      of his will.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That is very interesting.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I hope,” said Dr. Mortimer, “that you do not look with"
2852	"      suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from Sir"
2852	"      Charles, for I also had a thousand pounds left to me.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Indeed! And anyone else?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “There were many insignificant sums to individuals, and a large"
2852	"      number of public charities. The residue all went to Sir Henry.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And how much was the residue?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise. “I had no idea that so"
2852	"      gigantic a sum was involved,” said he."
2852	""
2852	"      “Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did not"
2852	"      know how very rich he was until we came to examine his"
2852	"      securities. The total value of the estate was close on to a"
2852	"      million.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Dear me! It is a stake for which a man might well play a"
2852	"      desperate game. And one more question, Dr. Mortimer. Supposing"
2852	"      that anything happened to our young friend here—you will forgive"
2852	"      the unpleasant hypothesis!—who would inherit the estate?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles’s younger brother died"
2852	"      unmarried, the estate would descend to the Desmonds, who are"
2852	"      distant cousins. James Desmond is an elderly clergyman in"
2852	"      Westmoreland.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Thank you. These details are all of great interest. Have you met"
2852	"      Mr. James Desmond?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes; he once came down to visit Sir Charles. He is a man of"
2852	"      venerable appearance and of saintly life. I remember that he"
2852	"      refused to accept any settlement from Sir Charles, though he"
2852	"      pressed it upon him.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And this man of simple tastes would be the heir to Sir Charles’s"
2852	"      thousands.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed. He"
2852	"      would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed"
2852	"      otherwise by the present owner, who can, of course, do what he"
2852	"      likes with it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And have you made your will, Sir Henry?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I’ve had no time, for it was only"
2852	"      yesterday that I learned how matters stood. But in any case I"
2852	"      feel that the money should go with the title and estate. That was"
2852	"      my poor uncle’s idea. How is the owner going to restore the"
2852	"      glories of the Baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up"
2852	"      the property? House, land, and dollars must go together.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Quite so. Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind with you as to the"
2852	"      advisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay."
2852	"      There is only one provision which I must make. You certainly must"
2852	"      not go alone.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Dr. Mortimer returns with me.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But Dr. Mortimer has his practice to attend to, and his house is"
2852	"      miles away from yours. With all the goodwill in the world he may"
2852	"      be unable to help you. No, Sir Henry, you must take with you"
2852	"      someone, a trusty man, who will be always by your side.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Is it possible that you could come yourself, Mr. Holmes?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “If matters came to a crisis I should endeavour to be present in"
2852	"      person; but you can understand that, with my extensive consulting"
2852	"      practice and with the constant appeals which reach me from many"
2852	"      quarters, it is impossible for me to be absent from London for an"
2852	"      indefinite time. At the present instant one of the most revered"
2852	"      names in England is being besmirched by a blackmailer, and only I"
2852	"      can stop a disastrous scandal. You will see how impossible it is"
2852	"      for me to go to Dartmoor.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Whom would you recommend, then?”"
2852	""
2852	"      Holmes laid his hand upon my arm. “If my friend would undertake"
2852	"      it there is no man who is better worth having at your side when"
2852	"      you are in a tight place. No one can say so more confidently than"
2852	"      I.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The proposition took me completely by surprise, but before I had"
2852	"      time to answer, Baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it"
2852	"      heartily."
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, now, that is real kind of you, Dr. Watson,” said he. “You"
2852	"      see how it is with me, and you know just as much about the matter"
2852	"      as I do. If you will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me"
2852	"      through I’ll never forget it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me, and I"
2852	"      was complimented by the words of Holmes and by the eagerness with"
2852	"      which the baronet hailed me as a companion."
2852	""
2852	"      “I will come, with pleasure,” said I. “I do not know how I could"
2852	"      employ my time better.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And you will report very carefully to me,” said Holmes. “When a"
2852	"      crisis comes, as it will do, I will direct how you shall act. I"
2852	"      suppose that by Saturday all might be ready?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Would that suit Dr. Watson?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Perfectly.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Then on Saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meet"
2852	"      at the ten-thirty train from Paddington.”"
2852	""
2852	"      We had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry of triumph,"
2852	"      and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown"
2852	"      boot from under a cabinet."
2852	""
2852	"      “My missing boot!” he cried."
2852	""
2852	"      “May all our difficulties vanish as easily!” said Sherlock"
2852	"      Holmes."
2852	""
2852	"      “But it is a very singular thing,” Dr. Mortimer remarked. “I"
2852	"      searched this room carefully before lunch.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And so did I,” said Baskerville. “Every inch of it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “There was certainly no boot in it then.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “In that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were"
2852	"      lunching.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The German was sent for but professed to know nothing of the"
2852	"      matter, nor could any inquiry clear it up. Another item had been"
2852	"      added to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small"
2852	"      mysteries which had succeeded each other so rapidly. Setting"
2852	"      aside the whole grim story of Sir Charles’s death, we had a line"
2852	"      of inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two days,"
2852	"      which included the receipt of the printed letter, the"
2852	"      black-bearded spy in the hansom, the loss of the new brown boot,"
2852	"      the loss of the old black boot, and now the return of the new"
2852	"      brown boot. Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to"
2852	"      Baker Street, and I knew from his drawn brows and keen face that"
2852	"      his mind, like my own, was busy in endeavouring to frame some"
2852	"      scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected"
2852	"      episodes could be fitted. All afternoon and late into the evening"
2852	"      he sat lost in tobacco and thought."
2852	""
2852	"      Just before dinner two telegrams were handed in. The first ran:"
2852	""
2852	"      Have just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall. BASKERVILLE."
2852	""
2852	"      The second:"
2852	""
2852	"      Visited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry to report"
2852	"      unable to trace cut sheet of _Times_. CARTWRIGHT."
2852	""
2852	"      “There go two of my threads, Watson. There is nothing more"
2852	"      stimulating than a case where everything goes against you. We"
2852	"      must cast round for another scent.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “We have still the cabman who drove the spy.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Exactly. I have wired to get his name and address from the"
2852	"      Official Registry. I should not be surprised if this were an"
2852	"      answer to my question.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The ring at the bell proved to be something even more"
2852	"      satisfactory than an answer, however, for the door opened and a"
2852	"      rough-looking fellow entered who was evidently the man himself."
2852	""
2852	"      “I got a message from the head office that a gent at this address"
2852	"      had been inquiring for No. 2704,” said he. “I’ve driven my cab"
2852	"      this seven years and never a word of complaint. I came here"
2852	"      straight from the Yard to ask you to your face what you had"
2852	"      against me.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I have nothing in the world against you, my good man,” said"
2852	"      Holmes. “On the contrary, I have half a sovereign for you if you"
2852	"      will give me a clear answer to my questions.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, I’ve had a good day and no mistake,” said the cabman with"
2852	"      a grin. “What was it you wanted to ask, sir?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “First of all your name and address, in case I want you again.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “John Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough. My cab is out of"
2852	"      Shipley’s Yard, near Waterloo Station.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Sherlock Holmes made a note of it."
2852	""
2852	"      “Now, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who came and watched"
2852	"      this house at ten o’clock this morning and afterwards followed"
2852	"      the two gentlemen down Regent Street.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The man looked surprised and a little embarrassed. “Why, there’s"
2852	"      no good my telling you things, for you seem to know as much as I"
2852	"      do already,” said he. “The truth is that the gentleman told me"
2852	"      that he was a detective and that I was to say nothing about him"
2852	"      to anyone.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “My good fellow; this is a very serious business, and you may"
2852	"      find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide"
2852	"      anything from me. You say that your fare told you that he was a"
2852	"      detective?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, he did.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “When did he say this?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “When he left me.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Did he say anything more?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He mentioned his name.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me. “Oh, he mentioned"
2852	"      his name, did he? That was imprudent. What was the name that he"
2852	"      mentioned?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “His name,” said the cabman, “was Mr. Sherlock Holmes.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than by"
2852	"      the cabman’s reply. For an instant he sat in silent amazement."
2852	"      Then he burst into a hearty laugh."
2852	""
2852	"      “A touch, Watson—an undeniable touch!” said he. “I feel a foil as"
2852	"      quick and supple as my own. He got home upon me very prettily"
2852	"      that time. So his name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, sir, that was the gentleman’s name.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Excellent! Tell me where you picked him up and all that"
2852	"      occurred.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He hailed me at half-past nine in Trafalgar Square. He said that"
2852	"      he was a detective, and he offered me two guineas if I would do"
2852	"      exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions. I was glad"
2852	"      enough to agree. First we drove down to the Northumberland Hotel"
2852	"      and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from"
2852	"      the rank. We followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near"
2852	"      here.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “This very door,” said Holmes."
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, I couldn’t be sure of that, but I dare say my fare knew"
2852	"      all about it. We pulled up halfway down the street and waited an"
2852	"      hour and a half. Then the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and"
2852	"      we followed down Baker Street and along—”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I know,” said Holmes."
2852	""
2852	"      “Until we got three-quarters down Regent Street. Then my"
2852	"      gentleman threw up the trap, and he cried that I should drive"
2852	"      right away to Waterloo Station as hard as I could go. I whipped"
2852	"      up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes. Then he paid"
2852	"      up his two guineas, like a good one, and away he went into the"
2852	"      station. Only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said:"
2852	"      ‘It might interest you to know that you have been driving Mr."
2852	"      Sherlock Holmes.’ That’s how I come to know the name.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I see. And you saw no more of him?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Not after he went into the station.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”"
2852	""
2852	"      The cabman scratched his head. “Well, he wasn’t altogether such"
2852	"      an easy gentleman to describe. I’d put him at forty years of age,"
2852	"      and he was of a middle height, two or three inches shorter than"
2852	"      you, sir. He was dressed like a toff, and he had a black beard,"
2852	"      cut square at the end, and a pale face. I don’t know as I could"
2852	"      say more than that.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Colour of his eyes?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, I can’t say that.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Nothing more that you can remember?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, sir; nothing.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, then, here is your half-sovereign. There’s another one"
2852	"      waiting for you if you can bring any more information."
2852	"      Good-night!”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Good-night, sir, and thank you!”"
2852	""
2852	"      John Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned to me with a"
2852	"      shrug of his shoulders and a rueful smile."
2852	""
2852	"      “Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,” said he."
2852	"      “The cunning rascal! He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry"
2852	"      Baskerville had consulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street,"
2852	"      conjectured that I had got the number of the cab and would lay my"
2852	"      hands on the driver, and so sent back this audacious message. I"
2852	"      tell you, Watson, this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of"
2852	"      our steel. I’ve been checkmated in London. I can only wish you"
2852	"      better luck in Devonshire. But I’m not easy in my mind about it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “About what?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “About sending you. It’s an ugly business, Watson, an ugly"
2852	"      dangerous business, and the more I see of it the less I like it."
2852	"      Yes, my dear fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I"
2852	"      shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in Baker"
2852	"      Street once more.”"

2852	"Baskerville Hall"
2852	""
2852	""
2852	"      Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the"
2852	"      appointed day, and we started as arranged for Devonshire. Mr."
2852	"      Sherlock Holmes drove with me to the station and gave me his last"
2852	"      parting injunctions and advice."
2852	""
2852	"      “I will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions,"
2852	"      Watson,” said he; “I wish you simply to report facts in the"
2852	"      fullest possible manner to me, and you can leave me to do the"
2852	"      theorizing.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “What sort of facts?” I asked."
2852	""
2852	"      “Anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon"
2852	"      the case, and especially the relations between young Baskerville"
2852	"      and his neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death"
2852	"      of Sir Charles. I have made some inquiries myself in the last few"
2852	"      days, but the results have, I fear, been negative. One thing only"
2852	"      appears to be certain, and that is that Mr. James Desmond, who is"
2852	"      the next heir, is an elderly gentleman of a very amiable"
2852	"      disposition, so that this persecution does not arise from him. I"
2852	"      really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our"
2852	"      calculations. There remain the people who will actually surround"
2852	"      Sir Henry Baskerville upon the moor.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Would it not be well in the first place to get rid of this"
2852	"      Barrymore couple?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “By no means. You could not make a greater mistake. If they are"
2852	"      innocent it would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty we"
2852	"      should be giving up all chance of bringing it home to them. No,"
2852	"      no, we will preserve them upon our list of suspects. Then there"
2852	"      is a groom at the Hall, if I remember right. There are two"
2852	"      moorland farmers. There is our friend Dr. Mortimer, whom I"
2852	"      believe to be entirely honest, and there is his wife, of whom we"
2852	"      know nothing. There is this naturalist, Stapleton, and there is"
2852	"      his sister, who is said to be a young lady of attractions. There"
2852	"      is Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who is also an unknown factor,"
2852	"      and there are one or two other neighbours. These are the folk who"
2852	"      must be your very special study.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I will do my best.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You have arms, I suppose?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, I thought it as well to take them.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Most certainly. Keep your revolver near you night and day, and"
2852	"      never relax your precautions.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Our friends had already secured a first-class carriage and were"
2852	"      waiting for us upon the platform."
2852	""
2852	"      “No, we have no news of any kind,” said Dr. Mortimer in answer to"
2852	"      my friend’s questions. “I can swear to one thing, and that is"
2852	"      that we have not been shadowed during the last two days. We have"
2852	"      never gone out without keeping a sharp watch, and no one could"
2852	"      have escaped our notice.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You have always kept together, I presume?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Except yesterday afternoon. I usually give up one day to pure"
2852	"      amusement when I come to town, so I spent it at the Museum of the"
2852	"      College of Surgeons.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And I went to look at the folk in the park,” said Baskerville."
2852	""
2852	"      “But we had no trouble of any kind.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It was imprudent, all the same,” said Holmes, shaking his head"
2852	"      and looking very grave. “I beg, Sir Henry, that you will not go"
2852	"      about alone. Some great misfortune will befall you if you do. Did"
2852	"      you get your other boot?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, sir, it is gone forever.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Indeed. That is very interesting. Well, good-bye,” he added as"
2852	"      the train began to glide down the platform. “Bear in mind, Sir"
2852	"      Henry, one of the phrases in that queer old legend which Dr."
2852	"      Mortimer has read to us, and avoid the moor in those hours of"
2852	"      darkness when the powers of evil are exalted.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind and"
2852	"      saw the tall, austere figure of Holmes standing motionless and"
2852	"      gazing after us."
2852	""
2852	"      The journey was a swift and pleasant one, and I spent it in"
2852	"      making the more intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in"
2852	"      playing with Dr. Mortimer’s spaniel. In a very few hours the"
2852	"      brown earth had become ruddy, the brick had changed to granite,"
2852	"      and red cows grazed in well-hedged fields where the lush grasses"
2852	"      and more luxuriant vegetation spoke of a richer, if a damper,"
2852	"      climate. Young Baskerville stared eagerly out of the window and"
2852	"      cried aloud with delight as he recognized the familiar features"
2852	"      of the Devon scenery."
2852	""
2852	"      “I’ve been over a good part of the world since I left it, Dr."
2852	"      Watson,” said he; “but I have never seen a place to compare with"
2852	"      it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear by his county,” I"
2852	"      remarked."
2852	""
2852	"      “It depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the"
2852	"      county,” said Dr. Mortimer. “A glance at our friend here reveals"
2852	"      the rounded head of the Celt, which carries inside it the Celtic"
2852	"      enthusiasm and power of attachment. Poor Sir Charles’s head was"
2852	"      of a very rare type, half Gaelic, half Ivernian in its"
2852	"      characteristics. But you were very young when you last saw"
2852	"      Baskerville Hall, were you not?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I was a boy in my teens at the time of my father’s death and had"
2852	"      never seen the Hall, for he lived in a little cottage on the"
2852	"      South Coast. Thence I went straight to a friend in America. I"
2852	"      tell you it is all as new to me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I’m"
2852	"      as keen as possible to see the moor.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Are you? Then your wish is easily granted, for there is your"
2852	"      first sight of the moor,” said Dr. Mortimer, pointing out of the"
2852	"      carriage window."
2852	""
2852	"      Over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood"
2852	"      there rose in the distance a grey, melancholy hill, with a"
2852	"      strange jagged summit, dim and vague in the distance, like some"
2852	"      fantastic landscape in a dream. Baskerville sat for a long time,"
2852	"      his eyes fixed upon it, and I read upon his eager face how much"
2852	"      it meant to him, this first sight of that strange spot where the"
2852	"      men of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark so"
2852	"      deep. There he sat, with his tweed suit and his American accent,"
2852	"      in the corner of a prosaic railway-carriage, and yet as I looked"
2852	"      at his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how true a"
2852	"      descendant he was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery, and"
2852	"      masterful men. There were pride, valour, and strength in his"
2852	"      thick brows, his sensitive nostrils, and his large hazel eyes. If"
2852	"      on that forbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should"
2852	"      lie before us, this was at least a comrade for whom one might"
2852	"      venture to take a risk with the certainty that he would bravely"
2852	"      share it."
2852	""
2852	"      The train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all"
2852	"      descended. Outside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette with"
2852	"      a pair of cobs was waiting. Our coming was evidently a great"
2852	"      event, for station-master and porters clustered round us to carry"
2852	"      out our luggage. It was a sweet, simple country spot, but I was"
2852	"      surprised to observe that by the gate there stood two soldierly"
2852	"      men in dark uniforms who leaned upon their short rifles and"
2852	"      glanced keenly at us as we passed. The coachman, a hard-faced,"
2852	"      gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and in a"
2852	"      few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road."
2852	"      Rolling pasture lands curved upward on either side of us, and old"
2852	"      gabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but"
2852	"      behind the peaceful and sunlit countryside there rose ever, dark"
2852	"      against the evening sky, the long, gloomy curve of the moor,"
2852	"      broken by the jagged and sinister hills."
2852	""
2852	"      The wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upward"
2852	"      through deep lanes worn by centuries of wheels, high banks on"
2852	"      either side, heavy with dripping moss and fleshy hart’s-tongue"
2852	"      ferns. Bronzing bracken and mottled bramble gleamed in the light"
2852	"      of the sinking sun. Still steadily rising, we passed over a"
2852	"      narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy stream which gushed"
2852	"      swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the grey boulders. Both"
2852	"      road and stream wound up through a valley dense with scrub oak"
2852	"      and fir. At every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation of"
2852	"      delight, looking eagerly about him and asking countless"
2852	"      questions. To his eyes all seemed beautiful, but to me a tinge of"
2852	"      melancholy lay upon the countryside, which bore so clearly the"
2852	"      mark of the waning year. Yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and"
2852	"      fluttered down upon us as we passed. The rattle of our wheels"
2852	"      died away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetation—sad"
2852	"      gifts, as it seemed to me, for Nature to throw before the"
2852	"      carriage of the returning heir of the Baskervilles."
2852	""
2852	"      “Halloa!” cried Dr. Mortimer, “what is this?”"
2852	""
2852	"      A steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying spur of the moor,"
2852	"      lay in front of us. On the summit, hard and clear like an"
2852	"      equestrian statue upon its pedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark"
2852	"      and stern, his rifle poised ready over his forearm. He was"
2852	"      watching the road along which we travelled."
2852	""
2852	"      “What is this, Perkins?” asked Dr. Mortimer."
2852	""
2852	"      Our driver half turned in his seat. “There’s a convict escaped"
2852	"      from Princetown, sir. He’s been out three days now, and the"
2852	"      warders watch every road and every station, but they’ve had no"
2852	"      sight of him yet. The farmers about here don’t like it, sir, and"
2852	"      that’s a fact.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, I understand that they get five pounds if they can give"
2852	"      information.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, sir, but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing"
2852	"      compared to the chance of having your throat cut. You see, it"
2852	"      isn’t like any ordinary convict. This is a man that would stick"
2852	"      at nothing.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Who is he, then?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It is Selden, the Notting Hill murderer.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I remembered the case well, for it was one in which Holmes had"
2852	"      taken an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the"
2852	"      crime and the wanton brutality which had marked all the actions"
2852	"      of the assassin. The commutation of his death sentence had been"
2852	"      due to some doubts as to his complete sanity, so atrocious was"
2852	"      his conduct. Our wagonette had topped a rise and in front of us"
2852	"      rose the huge expanse of the moor, mottled with gnarled and"
2852	"      craggy cairns and tors. A cold wind swept down from it and set us"
2852	"      shivering. Somewhere there, on that desolate plain, was lurking"
2852	"      this fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast, his"
2852	"      heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast"
2852	"      him out. It needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness"
2852	"      of the barren waste, the chilling wind, and the darkling sky."
2852	"      Even Baskerville fell silent and pulled his overcoat more closely"
2852	"      around him."
2852	""
2852	"      We had left the fertile country behind and beneath us. We looked"
2852	"      back on it now, the slanting rays of a low sun turning the"
2852	"      streams to threads of gold and glowing on the red earth new"
2852	"      turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands. The"
2852	"      road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder over huge russet and"
2852	"      olive slopes, sprinkled with giant boulders. Now and then we"
2852	"      passed a moorland cottage, walled and roofed with stone, with no"
2852	"      creeper to break its harsh outline. Suddenly we looked down into"
2852	"      a cuplike depression, patched with stunted oaks and firs which"
2852	"      had been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm. Two"
2852	"      high, narrow towers rose over the trees. The driver pointed with"
2852	"      his whip."
2852	""
2852	"      “Baskerville Hall,” said he."
2852	""
2852	"      Its master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and"
2852	"      shining eyes. A few minutes later we had reached the lodge-gates,"
2852	"      a maze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron, with weather-bitten"
2852	"      pillars on either side, blotched with lichens, and surmounted by"
2852	"      the boars’ heads of the Baskervilles. The lodge was a ruin of"
2852	"      black granite and bared ribs of rafters, but facing it was a new"
2852	"      building, half constructed, the first fruit of Sir Charles’s"
2852	"      South African gold."
2852	""
2852	"      Through the gateway we passed into the avenue, where the wheels"
2852	"      were again hushed amid the leaves, and the old trees shot their"
2852	"      branches in a sombre tunnel over our heads. Baskerville shuddered"
2852	"      as he looked up the long, dark drive to where the house glimmered"
2852	"      like a ghost at the farther end."
2852	""
2852	"      “Was it here?” he asked in a low voice."
2852	""
2852	"      “No, no, the yew alley is on the other side.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The young heir glanced round with a gloomy face."
2852	""
2852	"      “It’s no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in"
2852	"      such a place as this,” said he. “It’s enough to scare any man."
2852	"      I’ll have a row of electric lamps up here inside of six months,"
2852	"      and you won’t know it again, with a thousand candle-power Swan"
2852	"      and Edison right here in front of the hall door.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf, and the house lay"
2852	"      before us. In the fading light I could see that the centre was a"
2852	"      heavy block of building from which a porch projected. The whole"
2852	"      front was draped in ivy, with a patch clipped bare here and there"
2852	"      where a window or a coat of arms broke through the dark veil."
2852	"      From this central block rose the twin towers, ancient,"
2852	"      crenelated, and pierced with many loopholes. To right and left of"
2852	"      the turrets were more modern wings of black granite. A dull light"
2852	"      shone through heavy mullioned windows, and from the high chimneys"
2852	"      which rose from the steep, high-angled roof there sprang a single"
2852	"      black column of smoke."
2852	""
2852	"      “Welcome, Sir Henry! Welcome to Baskerville Hall!”"
2852	""
2852	"      A tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the"
2852	"      door of the wagonette. The figure of a woman was silhouetted"
2852	"      against the yellow light of the hall. She came out and helped the"
2852	"      man to hand down our bags."
2852	""
2852	"      “You don’t mind my driving straight home, Sir Henry?” said Dr."
2852	"      Mortimer. “My wife is expecting me.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Surely you will stay and have some dinner?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, I must go. I shall probably find some work awaiting me. I"
2852	"      would stay to show you over the house, but Barrymore will be a"
2852	"      better guide than I. Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day to"
2852	"      send for me if I can be of service.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The wheels died away down the drive while Sir Henry and I turned"
2852	"      into the hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us. It was a"
2852	"      fine apartment in which we found ourselves, large, lofty, and"
2852	"      heavily raftered with huge baulks of age-blackened oak. In the"
2852	"      great old-fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a"
2852	"      log-fire crackled and snapped. Sir Henry and I held out our hands"
2852	"      to it, for we were numb from our long drive. Then we gazed round"
2852	"      us at the high, thin window of old stained glass, the oak"
2852	"      panelling, the stags’ heads, the coats of arms upon the walls,"
2852	"      all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the central lamp."
2852	""
2852	"      “It’s just as I imagined it,” said Sir Henry. “Is it not the very"
2852	"      picture of an old family home? To think that this should be the"
2852	"      same hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived."
2852	"      It strikes me solemn to think of it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed"
2852	"      about him. The light beat upon him where he stood, but long"
2852	"      shadows trailed down the walls and hung like a black canopy above"
2852	"      him. Barrymore had returned from taking our luggage to our rooms."
2852	"      He stood in front of us now with the subdued manner of a"
2852	"      well-trained servant. He was a remarkable-looking man, tall,"
2852	"      handsome, with a square black beard and pale, distinguished"
2852	"      features."
2852	""
2852	"      “Would you wish dinner to be served at once, sir?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Is it ready?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “In a very few minutes, sir. You will find hot water in your"
2852	"      rooms. My wife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, to stay with you"
2852	"      until you have made your fresh arrangements, but you will"
2852	"      understand that under the new conditions this house will require"
2852	"      a considerable staff.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “What new conditions?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very retired life, and"
2852	"      we were able to look after his wants. You would, naturally, wish"
2852	"      to have more company, and so you will need changes in your"
2852	"      household.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Only when it is quite convenient to you, sir.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But your family have been with us for several generations, have"
2852	"      they not? I should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an"
2852	"      old family connection.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler’s white"
2852	"      face."
2852	""
2852	"      “I feel that also, sir, and so does my wife. But to tell the"
2852	"      truth, sir, we were both very much attached to Sir Charles, and"
2852	"      his death gave us a shock and made these surroundings very"
2852	"      painful to us. I fear that we shall never again be easy in our"
2852	"      minds at Baskerville Hall.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But what do you intend to do?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I have no doubt, sir, that we shall succeed in establishing"
2852	"      ourselves in some business. Sir Charles’s generosity has given us"
2852	"      the means to do so. And now, sir, perhaps I had best show you to"
2852	"      your rooms.”"
2852	""
2852	"      A square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall,"
2852	"      approached by a double stair. From this central point two long"
2852	"      corridors extended the whole length of the building, from which"
2852	"      all the bedrooms opened. My own was in the same wing as"
2852	"      Baskerville’s and almost next door to it. These rooms appeared to"
2852	"      be much more modern than the central part of the house, and the"
2852	"      bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the"
2852	"      sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind."
2852	""
2852	"      But the dining-room which opened out of the hall was a place of"
2852	"      shadow and gloom. It was a long chamber with a step separating"
2852	"      the dais where the family sat from the lower portion reserved for"
2852	"      their dependents. At one end a minstrel’s gallery overlooked it."
2852	"      Black beams shot across above our heads, with a smoke-darkened"
2852	"      ceiling beyond them. With rows of flaring torches to light it up,"
2852	"      and the colour and rude hilarity of an old-time banquet, it might"
2852	"      have softened; but now, when two black-clothed gentlemen sat in"
2852	"      the little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp, one’s voice"
2852	"      became hushed and one’s spirit subdued. A dim line of ancestors,"
2852	"      in every variety of dress, from the Elizabethan knight to the"
2852	"      buck of the Regency, stared down upon us and daunted us by their"
2852	"      silent company. We talked little, and I for one was glad when the"
2852	"      meal was over and we were able to retire into the modern"
2852	"      billiard-room and smoke a cigarette."
2852	""
2852	"      “My word, it isn’t a very cheerful place,” said Sir Henry. “I"
2852	"      suppose one can tone down to it, but I feel a bit out of the"
2852	"      picture at present. I don’t wonder that my uncle got a little"
2852	"      jumpy if he lived all alone in such a house as this. However, if"
2852	"      it suits you, we will retire early tonight, and perhaps things"
2852	"      may seem more cheerful in the morning.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I drew aside my curtains before I went to bed and looked out from"
2852	"      my window. It opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of"
2852	"      the hall door. Beyond, two copses of trees moaned and swung in a"
2852	"      rising wind. A half moon broke through the rifts of racing"
2852	"      clouds. In its cold light I saw beyond the trees a broken fringe"
2852	"      of rocks, and the long, low curve of the melancholy moor. I"
2852	"      closed the curtain, feeling that my last impression was in"
2852	"      keeping with the rest."
2852	""
2852	"      And yet it was not quite the last. I found myself weary and yet"
2852	"      wakeful, tossing restlessly from side to side, seeking for the"
2852	"      sleep which would not come. Far away a chiming clock struck out"
2852	"      the quarters of the hours, but otherwise a deathly silence lay"
2852	"      upon the old house. And then suddenly, in the very dead of the"
2852	"      night, there came a sound to my ears, clear, resonant, and"
2852	"      unmistakable. It was the sob of a woman, the muffled, strangling"
2852	"      gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow. I sat up in"
2852	"      bed and listened intently. The noise could not have been far away"
2852	"      and was certainly in the house. For half an hour I waited with"
2852	"      every nerve on the alert, but there came no other sound save the"
2852	"      chiming clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall."

2852	""
2852	""
2852	"      The fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface"
2852	"      from our minds the grim and grey impression which had been left"
2852	"      upon both of us by our first experience of Baskerville Hall. As"
2852	"      Sir Henry and I sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through"
2852	"      the high mullioned windows, throwing watery patches of colour"
2852	"      from the coats of arms which covered them. The dark panelling"
2852	"      glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it was hard to realise"
2852	"      that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom"
2852	"      into our souls upon the evening before."
2852	""
2852	"      “I guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to"
2852	"      blame!” said the baronet. “We were tired with our journey and"
2852	"      chilled by our drive, so we took a grey view of the place. Now we"
2852	"      are fresh and well, so it is all cheerful once more.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And yet it was not entirely a question of imagination,” I"
2852	"      answered. “Did you, for example, happen to hear someone, a woman"
2852	"      I think, sobbing in the night?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That is curious, for I did when I was half asleep fancy that I"
2852	"      heard something of the sort. I waited quite a time, but there was"
2852	"      no more of it, so I concluded that it was all a dream.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sob"
2852	"      of a woman.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “We must ask about this right away.” He rang the bell and asked"
2852	"      Barrymore whether he could account for our experience. It seemed"
2852	"      to me that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler"
2852	"      still as he listened to his master’s question."
2852	""
2852	"      “There are only two women in the house, Sir Henry,” he answered."
2852	"      “One is the scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other wing. The"
2852	"      other is my wife, and I can answer for it that the sound could"
2852	"      not have come from her.”"
2852	""
2852	"      And yet he lied as he said it, for it chanced that after"
2852	"      breakfast I met Mrs. Barrymore in the long corridor with the sun"
2852	"      full upon her face. She was a large, impassive, heavy-featured"
2852	"      woman with a stern set expression of mouth. But her telltale eyes"
2852	"      were red and glanced at me from between swollen lids. It was she,"
2852	"      then, who wept in the night, and if she did so her husband must"
2852	"      know it. Yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery in"
2852	"      declaring that it was not so. Why had he done this? And why did"
2852	"      she weep so bitterly? Already round this pale-faced, handsome,"
2852	"      black-bearded man there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery"
2852	"      and of gloom. It was he who had been the first to discover the"
2852	"      body of Sir Charles, and we had only his word for all the"
2852	"      circumstances which led up to the old man’s death. Was it"
2852	"      possible that it was Barrymore, after all, whom we had seen in"
2852	"      the cab in Regent Street? The beard might well have been the"
2852	"      same. The cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but such"
2852	"      an impression might easily have been erroneous. How could I"
2852	"      settle the point forever? Obviously the first thing to do was to"
2852	"      see the Grimpen postmaster and find whether the test telegram had"
2852	"      really been placed in Barrymore’s own hands. Be the answer what"
2852	"      it might, I should at least have something to report to Sherlock"
2852	"      Holmes."
2852	""
2852	"      Sir Henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast, so that"
2852	"      the time was propitious for my excursion. It was a pleasant walk"
2852	"      of four miles along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a"
2852	"      small grey hamlet, in which two larger buildings, which proved to"
2852	"      be the inn and the house of Dr. Mortimer, stood high above the"
2852	"      rest. The postmaster, who was also the village grocer, had a"
2852	"      clear recollection of the telegram."
2852	""
2852	"      “Certainly, sir,” said he, “I had the telegram delivered to Mr."
2852	"      Barrymore exactly as directed.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Who delivered it?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “My boy here. James, you delivered that telegram to Mr. Barrymore"
2852	"      at the Hall last week, did you not?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, father, I delivered it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Into his own hands?” I asked."
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, he was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not put"
2852	"      it into his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore’s hands,"
2852	"      and she promised to deliver it at once.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Did you see Mr. Barrymore?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, sir; I tell you he was in the loft.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “If you didn’t see him, how do you know he was in the loft?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, surely his own wife ought to know where he is,” said the"
2852	"      postmaster testily. “Didn’t he get the telegram? If there is any"
2852	"      mistake it is for Mr. Barrymore himself to complain.”"
2852	""
2852	"      It seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther, but it was"
2852	"      clear that in spite of Holmes’s ruse we had no proof that"
2852	"      Barrymore had not been in London all the time. Suppose that it"
2852	"      were so—suppose that the same man had been the last who had seen"
2852	"      Sir Charles alive, and the first to dog the new heir when he"
2852	"      returned to England. What then? Was he the agent of others or had"
2852	"      he some sinister design of his own? What interest could he have"
2852	"      in persecuting the Baskerville family? I thought of the strange"
2852	"      warning clipped out of the leading article of the _Times_. Was"
2852	"      that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was"
2852	"      bent upon counteracting his schemes? The only conceivable motive"
2852	"      was that which had been suggested by Sir Henry, that if the"
2852	"      family could be scared away a comfortable and permanent home"
2852	"      would be secured for the Barrymores. But surely such an"
2852	"      explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the"
2852	"      deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an invisible"
2852	"      net round the young baronet. Holmes himself had said that no more"
2852	"      complex case had come to him in all the long series of his"
2852	"      sensational investigations. I prayed, as I walked back along the"
2852	"      grey, lonely road, that my friend might soon be freed from his"
2852	"      preoccupations and able to come down to take this heavy burden of"
2852	"      responsibility from my shoulders."
2852	""
2852	"      Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running"
2852	"      feet behind me and by a voice which called me by name. I turned,"
2852	"      expecting to see Dr. Mortimer, but to my surprise it was a"
2852	"      stranger who was pursuing me. He was a small, slim, clean-shaven,"
2852	"      prim-faced man, flaxen-haired and lean-jawed, between thirty and"
2852	"      forty years of age, dressed in a grey suit and wearing a straw"
2852	"      hat. A tin box for botanical specimens hung over his shoulder and"
2852	"      he carried a green butterfly-net in one of his hands."
2852	""
2852	"      “You will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson,” said he"
2852	"      as he came panting up to where I stood. “Here on the moor we are"
2852	"      homely folk and do not wait for formal introductions. You may"
2852	"      possibly have heard my name from our mutual friend, Mortimer. I"
2852	"      am Stapleton, of Merripit House.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Your net and box would have told me as much,” said I, “for I"
2852	"      knew that Mr. Stapleton was a naturalist. But how did you know"
2852	"      me?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I have been calling on Mortimer, and he pointed you out to me"
2852	"      from the window of his surgery as you passed. As our road lay the"
2852	"      same way I thought that I would overtake you and introduce"
2852	"      myself. I trust that Sir Henry is none the worse for his"
2852	"      journey?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He is very well, thank you.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “We were all rather afraid that after the sad death of Sir"
2852	"      Charles the new baronet might refuse to live here. It is asking"
2852	"      much of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a place of"
2852	"      this kind, but I need not tell you that it means a very great"
2852	"      deal to the countryside. Sir Henry has, I suppose, no"
2852	"      superstitious fears in the matter?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I do not think that it is likely.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the"
2852	"      family?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I have heard it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here!"
2852	"      Any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a"
2852	"      creature upon the moor.” He spoke with a smile, but I seemed to"
2852	"      read in his eyes that he took the matter more seriously. “The"
2852	"      story took a great hold upon the imagination of Sir Charles, and"
2852	"      I have no doubt that it led to his tragic end.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But how?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “His nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog"
2852	"      might have had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart. I fancy"
2852	"      that he really did see something of the kind upon that last night"
2852	"      in the yew alley. I feared that some disaster might occur, for I"
2852	"      was very fond of the old man, and I knew that his heart was"
2852	"      weak.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “How did you know that?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “My friend Mortimer told me.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You think, then, that some dog pursued Sir Charles, and that he"
2852	"      died of fright in consequence?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Have you any better explanation?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I have not come to any conclusion.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”"
2852	""
2852	"      The words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the"
2852	"      placid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no"
2852	"      surprise was intended."
2852	""
2852	"      “It is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, Dr."
2852	"      Watson,” said he. “The records of your detective have reached us"
2852	"      here, and you could not celebrate him without being known"
2852	"      yourself. When Mortimer told me your name he could not deny your"
2852	"      identity. If you are here, then it follows that Mr. Sherlock"
2852	"      Holmes is interesting himself in the matter, and I am naturally"
2852	"      curious to know what view he may take.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I am afraid that I cannot answer that question.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “May I ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He cannot leave town at present. He has other cases which engage"
2852	"      his attention.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “What a pity! He might throw some light on that which is so dark"
2852	"      to us. But as to your own researches, if there is any possible"
2852	"      way in which I can be of service to you I trust that you will"
2852	"      command me. If I had any indication of the nature of your"
2852	"      suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case, I might"
2852	"      perhaps even now give you some aid or advice.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend,"
2852	"      Sir Henry, and that I need no help of any kind.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Excellent!” said Stapleton. “You are perfectly right to be wary"
2852	"      and discreet. I am justly reproved for what I feel was an"
2852	"      unjustifiable intrusion, and I promise you that I will not"
2852	"      mention the matter again.”"
2852	""
2852	"      We had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from"
2852	"      the road and wound away across the moor. A steep,"
2852	"      boulder-sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone"
2852	"      days been cut into a granite quarry. The face which was turned"
2852	"      towards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns and brambles growing"
2852	"      in its niches. From over a distant rise there floated a grey"
2852	"      plume of smoke."
2852	""
2852	"      “A moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to Merripit"
2852	"      House,” said he. “Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may have"
2852	"      the pleasure of introducing you to my sister.”"
2852	""
2852	"      My first thought was that I should be by Sir Henry’s side. But"
2852	"      then I remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his"
2852	"      study table was littered. It was certain that I could not help"
2852	"      with those. And Holmes had expressly said that I should study the"
2852	"      neighbours upon the moor. I accepted Stapleton’s invitation, and"
2852	"      we turned together down the path."
2852	""
2852	"      “It is a wonderful place, the moor,” said he, looking round over"
2852	"      the undulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged"
2852	"      granite foaming up into fantastic surges. “You never tire of the"
2852	"      moor. You cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains."
2852	"      It is so vast, and so barren, and so mysterious.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You know it well, then?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I have only been here two years. The residents would call me a"
2852	"      newcomer. We came shortly after Sir Charles settled. But my"
2852	"      tastes led me to explore every part of the country round, and I"
2852	"      should think that there are few men who know it better than I"
2852	"      do.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Is it hard to know?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Very hard. You see, for example, this great plain to the north"
2852	"      here with the queer hills breaking out of it. Do you observe"
2852	"      anything remarkable about that?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It would be a rare place for a gallop.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You would naturally think so and the thought has cost several"
2852	"      their lives before now. You notice those bright green spots"
2852	"      scattered thickly over it?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, they seem more fertile than the rest.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Stapleton laughed. “That is the great Grimpen Mire,” said he. “A"
2852	"      false step yonder means death to man or beast. Only yesterday I"
2852	"      saw one of the moor ponies wander into it. He never came out. I"
2852	"      saw his head for quite a long time craning out of the bog-hole,"
2852	"      but it sucked him down at last. Even in dry seasons it is a"
2852	"      danger to cross it, but after these autumn rains it is an awful"
2852	"      place. And yet I can find my way to the very heart of it and"
2852	"      return alive. By George, there is another of those miserable"
2852	"      ponies!”"
2852	""
2852	"      Something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges."
2852	"      Then a long, agonised, writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful"
2852	"      cry echoed over the moor. It turned me cold with horror, but my"
2852	"      companion’s nerves seemed to be stronger than mine."
2852	""
2852	"      “It’s gone!” said he. “The mire has him. Two in two days, and"
2852	"      many more, perhaps, for they get in the way of going there in the"
2852	"      dry weather and never know the difference until the mire has them"
2852	"      in its clutches. It’s a bad place, the great Grimpen Mire.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And you say you can penetrate it?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, there are one or two paths which a very active man can"
2852	"      take. I have found them out.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But why should you wish to go into so horrible a place?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, you see the hills beyond? They are really islands cut off"
2852	"      on all sides by the impassable mire, which has crawled round them"
2852	"      in the course of years. That is where the rare plants and the"
2852	"      butterflies are, if you have the wit to reach them.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I shall try my luck some day.”"
2852	""
2852	"      He looked at me with a surprised face. “For God’s sake put such"
2852	"      an idea out of your mind,” said he. “Your blood would be upon my"
2852	"      head. I assure you that there would not be the least chance of"
2852	"      your coming back alive. It is only by remembering certain complex"
2852	"      landmarks that I am able to do it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Halloa!” I cried. “What is that?”"
2852	""
2852	"      A long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept over the moor. It"
2852	"      filled the whole air, and yet it was impossible to say whence it"
2852	"      came. From a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and then"
2852	"      sank back into a melancholy, throbbing murmur once again."
2852	"      Stapleton looked at me with a curious expression in his face."
2852	""
2852	"      “Queer place, the moor!” said he."
2852	""
2852	"      “But what is it?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “The peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling for"
2852	"      its prey. I’ve heard it once or twice before, but never quite so"
2852	"      loud.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the huge"
2852	"      swelling plain, mottled with the green patches of rushes. Nothing"
2852	"      stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which"
2852	"      croaked loudly from a tor behind us."
2852	""
2852	"      “You are an educated man. You don’t believe such nonsense as"
2852	"      that?” said I. “What do you think is the cause of so strange a"
2852	"      sound?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Bogs make queer noises sometimes. It’s the mud settling, or the"
2852	"      water rising, or something.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, no, that was a living voice.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, perhaps it was. Did you ever hear a bittern booming?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, I never did.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It’s a very rare bird—practically extinct—in England now, but"
2852	"      all things are possible upon the moor. Yes, I should not be"
2852	"      surprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last"
2852	"      of the bitterns.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It’s the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard in my"
2852	"      life.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, it’s rather an uncanny place altogether. Look at the"
2852	"      hillside yonder. What do you make of those?”"
2852	""
2852	"      The whole steep slope was covered with grey circular rings of"
2852	"      stone, a score of them at least."
2852	""
2852	"      “What are they? Sheep-pens?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, they are the homes of our worthy ancestors. Prehistoric man"
2852	"      lived thickly on the moor, and as no one in particular has lived"
2852	"      there since, we find all his little arrangements exactly as he"
2852	"      left them. These are his wigwams with the roofs off. You can even"
2852	"      see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go"
2852	"      inside."
2852	""
2852	"      “But it is quite a town. When was it inhabited?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Neolithic man—no date.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “What did he do?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he learned to dig for"
2852	"      tin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe. Look"
2852	"      at the great trench in the opposite hill. That is his mark. Yes,"
2852	"      you will find some very singular points about the moor, Dr."
2852	"      Watson. Oh, excuse me an instant! It is surely Cyclopides.”"
2852	""
2852	"      A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an"
2852	"      instant Stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed"
2852	"      in pursuit of it. To my dismay the creature flew straight for the"
2852	"      great mire, and my acquaintance never paused for an instant,"
2852	"      bounding from tuft to tuft behind it, his green net waving in the"
2852	"      air. His grey clothes and jerky, zigzag, irregular progress made"
2852	"      him not unlike some huge moth himself. I was standing watching"
2852	"      his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary"
2852	"      activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the"
2852	"      treacherous mire, when I heard the sound of steps and, turning"
2852	"      round, found a woman near me upon the path. She had come from the"
2852	"      direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of"
2852	"      Merripit House, but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was"
2852	"      quite close."
2852	""
2852	"      I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had"
2852	"      been told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor,"
2852	"      and I remembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a"
2852	"      beauty. The woman who approached me was certainly that, and of a"
2852	"      most uncommon type. There could not have been a greater contrast"
2852	"      between brother and sister, for Stapleton was neutral tinted,"
2852	"      with light hair and grey eyes, while she was darker than any"
2852	"      brunette whom I have seen in England—slim, elegant, and tall. She"
2852	"      had a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it might have"
2852	"      seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the"
2852	"      beautiful dark, eager eyes. With her perfect figure and elegant"
2852	"      dress she was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonely"
2852	"      moorland path. Her eyes were on her brother as I turned, and then"
2852	"      she quickened her pace towards me. I had raised my hat and was"
2852	"      about to make some explanatory remark when her own words turned"
2852	"      all my thoughts into a new channel."
2852	""
2852	"      “Go back!” she said. “Go straight back to London, instantly.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I could only stare at her in stupid surprise. Her eyes blazed at"
2852	"      me, and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot."
2852	""
2852	"      “Why should I go back?” I asked."
2852	""
2852	"      “I cannot explain.” She spoke in a low, eager voice, with a"
2852	"      curious lisp in her utterance. “But for God’s sake do what I ask"
2852	"      you. Go back and never set foot upon the moor again.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But I have only just come.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Man, man!” she cried. “Can you not tell when a warning is for"
2852	"      your own good? Go back to London! Start tonight! Get away from"
2852	"      this place at all costs! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a word"
2852	"      of what I have said. Would you mind getting that orchid for me"
2852	"      among the mare’s-tails yonder? We are very rich in orchids on the"
2852	"      moor, though, of course, you are rather late to see the beauties"
2852	"      of the place.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing"
2852	"      hard and flushed with his exertions."
2852	""
2852	"      “Halloa, Beryl!” said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of"
2852	"      his greeting was not altogether a cordial one."
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, Jack, you are very hot.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare and seldom"
2852	"      found in the late autumn. What a pity that I should have missed"
2852	"      him!” He spoke unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced"
2852	"      incessantly from the girl to me."
2852	""
2852	"      “You have introduced yourselves, I can see.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him to"
2852	"      see the true beauties of the moor.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Why, who do you think this is?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, no,” said I. “Only a humble commoner, but his friend. My"
2852	"      name is Dr. Watson.”"
2852	""
2852	"      A flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. “We have"
2852	"      been talking at cross purposes,” said she."
2852	""
2852	"      “Why, you had not very much time for talk,” her brother remarked"
2852	"      with the same questioning eyes."
2852	""
2852	"      “I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being"
2852	"      merely a visitor,” said she. “It cannot much matter to him"
2852	"      whether it is early or late for the orchids. But you will come"
2852	"      on, will you not, and see Merripit House?”"
2852	""
2852	"      A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the"
2852	"      farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into"
2852	"      repair and turned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surrounded"
2852	"      it, but the trees, as is usual upon the moor, were stunted and"
2852	"      nipped, and the effect of the whole place was mean and"
2852	"      melancholy. We were admitted by a strange, wizened, rusty-coated"
2852	"      old manservant, who seemed in keeping with the house. Inside,"
2852	"      however, there were large rooms furnished with an elegance in"
2852	"      which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady. As I looked"
2852	"      from their windows at the interminable granite-flecked moor"
2852	"      rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could not but marvel"
2852	"      at what could have brought this highly educated man and this"
2852	"      beautiful woman to live in such a place."
2852	""
2852	"      “Queer spot to choose, is it not?” said he as if in answer to my"
2852	"      thought. “And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we"
2852	"      not, Beryl?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Quite happy,” said she, but there was no ring of conviction in"
2852	"      her words."
2852	""
2852	"      “I had a school,” said Stapleton. “It was in the north country."
2852	"      The work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and"
2852	"      uninteresting, but the privilege of living with youth, of helping"
2852	"      to mould those young minds, and of impressing them with one’s own"
2852	"      character and ideals was very dear to me. However, the fates were"
2852	"      against us. A serious epidemic broke out in the school and three"
2852	"      of the boys died. It never recovered from the blow, and much of"
2852	"      my capital was irretrievably swallowed up. And yet, if it were"
2852	"      not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys, I"
2852	"      could rejoice over my own misfortune, for, with my strong tastes"
2852	"      for botany and zoology, I find an unlimited field of work here,"
2852	"      and my sister is as devoted to Nature as I am. All this, Dr."
2852	"      Watson, has been brought upon your head by your expression as you"
2852	"      surveyed the moor out of our window.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little"
2852	"      dull—less for you, perhaps, than for your sister.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, no, I am never dull,” said she quickly."
2852	""
2852	"      “We have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting"
2852	"      neighbours. Dr. Mortimer is a most learned man in his own line."
2852	"      Poor Sir Charles was also an admirable companion. We knew him"
2852	"      well and miss him more than I can tell. Do you think that I"
2852	"      should intrude if I were to call this afternoon and make the"
2852	"      acquaintance of Sir Henry?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I am sure that he would be delighted.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so. We may"
2852	"      in our humble way do something to make things more easy for him"
2852	"      until he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings. Will you"
2852	"      come upstairs, Dr. Watson, and inspect my collection of"
2852	"      Lepidoptera? I think it is the most complete one in the"
2852	"      south-west of England. By the time that you have looked through"
2852	"      them lunch will be almost ready.”"
2852	""
2852	"      But I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of the"
2852	"      moor, the death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which"
2852	"      had been associated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, all"
2852	"      these things tinged my thoughts with sadness. Then on the top of"
2852	"      these more or less vague impressions there had come the definite"
2852	"      and distinct warning of Miss Stapleton, delivered with such"
2852	"      intense earnestness that I could not doubt that some grave and"
2852	"      deep reason lay behind it. I resisted all pressure to stay for"
2852	"      lunch, and I set off at once upon my return journey, taking the"
2852	"      grass-grown path by which we had come."
2852	""
2852	"      It seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for"
2852	"      those who knew it, for before I had reached the road I was"
2852	"      astounded to see Miss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side"
2852	"      of the track. Her face was beautifully flushed with her exertions"
2852	"      and she held her hand to her side."
2852	""
2852	"      “I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson,”"
2852	"      said she. “I had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop,"
2852	"      or my brother may miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am"
2852	"      about the stupid mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir"
2852	"      Henry. Please forget the words I said, which have no application"
2852	"      whatever to you.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But I can’t forget them, Miss Stapleton,” said I. “I am Sir"
2852	"      Henry’s friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine."
2852	"      Tell me why it was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should"
2852	"      return to London.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “A woman’s whim, Dr. Watson. When you know me better you will"
2852	"      understand that I cannot always give reasons for what I say or"
2852	"      do.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, no. I remember the thrill in your voice. I remember the look"
2852	"      in your eyes. Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Stapleton,"
2852	"      for ever since I have been here I have been conscious of shadows"
2852	"      all round me. Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with"
2852	"      little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with"
2852	"      no guide to point the track. Tell me then what it was that you"
2852	"      meant, and I will promise to convey your warning to Sir Henry.”"
2852	""
2852	"      An expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her"
2852	"      face, but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me."
2852	""
2852	"      “You make too much of it, Dr. Watson,” said she. “My brother and"
2852	"      I were very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles. We knew him"
2852	"      very intimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to our"
2852	"      house. He was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the"
2852	"      family, and when this tragedy came I naturally felt that there"
2852	"      must be some grounds for the fears which he had expressed. I was"
2852	"      distressed therefore when another member of the family came down"
2852	"      to live here, and I felt that he should be warned of the danger"
2852	"      which he will run. That was all which I intended to convey."
2852	""
2852	"      “But what is the danger?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You know the story of the hound?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I do not believe in such nonsense.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But I do. If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take him"
2852	"      away from a place which has always been fatal to his family. The"
2852	"      world is wide. Why should he wish to live at the place of"
2852	"      danger?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Because it _is_ the place of danger. That is Sir Henry’s nature."
2852	"      I fear that unless you can give me some more definite information"
2852	"      than this it would be impossible to get him to move.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything"
2852	"      definite.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant"
2852	"      no more than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not"
2852	"      wish your brother to overhear what you said? There is nothing to"
2852	"      which he, or anyone else, could object.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he"
2852	"      thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. He"
2852	"      would be very angry if he knew that I have said anything which"
2852	"      might induce Sir Henry to go away. But I have done my duty now"
2852	"      and I will say no more. I must go back, or he will miss me and"
2852	"      suspect that I have seen you. Good-bye!” She turned and had"
2852	"      disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders, while"
2852	"      I, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to"
2852	"      Baskerville Hall."

2852	"      Baskerville Hall, October 13th."
2852	""
2852	"      MY DEAR HOLMES,"
2852	""
2852	"      My previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to"
2852	"      date as to all that has occurred in this most God-forsaken corner"
2852	"      of the world. The longer one stays here the more does the spirit"
2852	"      of the moor sink into one’s soul, its vastness, and also its grim"
2852	"      charm. When you are once out upon its bosom you have left all"
2852	"      traces of modern England behind you, but, on the other hand, you"
2852	"      are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of the"
2852	"      prehistoric people. On all sides of you as you walk are the"
2852	"      houses of these forgotten folk, with their graves and the huge"
2852	"      monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples. As you"
2852	"      look at their grey stone huts against the scarred hillsides you"
2852	"      leave your own age behind you, and if you were to see a"
2852	"      skin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the low door fitting a"
2852	"      flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his bow, you would feel"
2852	"      that his presence there was more natural than your own. The"
2852	"      strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what"
2852	"      must always have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian,"
2852	"      but I could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried"
2852	"      race who were forced to accept that which none other would"
2852	"      occupy."
2852	""
2852	"      All this, however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent me"
2852	"      and will probably be very uninteresting to your severely"
2852	"      practical mind. I can still remember your complete indifference"
2852	"      as to whether the sun moved round the earth or the earth round"
2852	"      the sun. Let me, therefore, return to the facts concerning Sir"
2852	"      Henry Baskerville."
2852	""
2852	"      If you have not had any report within the last few days it is"
2852	"      because up to today there was nothing of importance to relate."
2852	"      Then a very surprising circumstance occurred, which I shall tell"
2852	"      you in due course. But, first of all, I must keep you in touch"
2852	"      with some of the other factors in the situation."
2852	""
2852	"      One of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped"
2852	"      convict upon the moor. There is strong reason now to believe that"
2852	"      he has got right away, which is a considerable relief to the"
2852	"      lonely householders of this district. A fortnight has passed"
2852	"      since his flight, during which he has not been seen and nothing"
2852	"      has been heard of him. It is surely inconceivable that he could"
2852	"      have held out upon the moor during all that time. Of course, so"
2852	"      far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all. Any"
2852	"      one of these stone huts would give him a hiding-place. But there"
2852	"      is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of"
2852	"      the moor sheep. We think, therefore, that he has gone, and the"
2852	"      outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence."
2852	""
2852	"      We are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could"
2852	"      take good care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy"
2852	"      moments when I have thought of the Stapletons. They live miles"
2852	"      from any help. There are one maid, an old manservant, the sister,"
2852	"      and the brother, the latter not a very strong man. They would be"
2852	"      helpless in the hands of a desperate fellow like this Notting"
2852	"      Hill criminal if he could once effect an entrance. Both Sir Henry"
2852	"      and I were concerned at their situation, and it was suggested"
2852	"      that Perkins the groom should go over to sleep there, but"
2852	"      Stapleton would not hear of it."
2852	""
2852	"      The fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins to display a"
2852	"      considerable interest in our fair neighbour. It is not to be"
2852	"      wondered at, for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an"
2852	"      active man like him, and she is a very fascinating and beautiful"
2852	"      woman. There is something tropical and exotic about her which"
2852	"      forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother."
2852	"      Yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires. He has certainly a"
2852	"      very marked influence over her, for I have seen her continually"
2852	"      glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what"
2852	"      she said. I trust that he is kind to her. There is a dry glitter"
2852	"      in his eyes and a firm set of his thin lips, which goes with a"
2852	"      positive and possibly a harsh nature. You would find him an"
2852	"      interesting study."
2852	""
2852	"      He came over to call upon Baskerville on that first day, and the"
2852	"      very next morning he took us both to show us the spot where the"
2852	"      legend of the wicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin. It"
2852	"      was an excursion of some miles across the moor to a place which"
2852	"      is so dismal that it might have suggested the story. We found a"
2852	"      short valley between rugged tors which led to an open, grassy"
2852	"      space flecked over with the white cotton grass. In the middle of"
2852	"      it rose two great stones, worn and sharpened at the upper end"
2852	"      until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous"
2852	"      beast. In every way it corresponded with the scene of the old"
2852	"      tragedy. Sir Henry was much interested and asked Stapleton more"
2852	"      than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the"
2852	"      interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men. He spoke"
2852	"      lightly, but it was evident that he was very much in earnest."
2852	"      Stapleton was guarded in his replies, but it was easy to see that"
2852	"      he said less than he might, and that he would not express his"
2852	"      whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the"
2852	"      baronet. He told us of similar cases, where families had suffered"
2852	"      from some evil influence, and he left us with the impression that"
2852	"      he shared the popular view upon the matter."
2852	""
2852	"      On our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it was"
2852	"      there that Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton."
2852	"      From the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly"
2852	"      attracted by her, and I am much mistaken if the feeling was not"
2852	"      mutual. He referred to her again and again on our walk home, and"
2852	"      since then hardly a day has passed that we have not seen"
2852	"      something of the brother and sister. They dine here tonight, and"
2852	"      there is some talk of our going to them next week. One would"
2852	"      imagine that such a match would be very welcome to Stapleton, and"
2852	"      yet I have more than once caught a look of the strongest"
2852	"      disapprobation in his face when Sir Henry has been paying some"
2852	"      attention to his sister. He is much attached to her, no doubt,"
2852	"      and would lead a lonely life without her, but it would seem the"
2852	"      height of selfishness if he were to stand in the way of her"
2852	"      making so brilliant a marriage. Yet I am certain that he does not"
2852	"      wish their intimacy to ripen into love, and I have several times"
2852	"      observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from being"
2852	"      _tête-à-tête_. By the way, your instructions to me never to allow"
2852	"      Sir Henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a"
2852	"      love affair were to be added to our other difficulties. My"
2852	"      popularity would soon suffer if I were to carry out your orders"
2852	"      to the letter."
2852	""
2852	"      The other day—Thursday, to be more exact—Dr. Mortimer lunched"
2852	"      with us. He has been excavating a barrow at Long Down and has got"
2852	"      a prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy. Never was"
2852	"      there such a single-minded enthusiast as he! The Stapletons came"
2852	"      in afterwards, and the good doctor took us all to the yew alley"
2852	"      at Sir Henry’s request to show us exactly how everything occurred"
2852	"      upon that fatal night. It is a long, dismal walk, the yew alley,"
2852	"      between two high walls of clipped hedge, with a narrow band of"
2852	"      grass upon either side. At the far end is an old tumble-down"
2852	"      summer-house. Halfway down is the moor-gate, where the old"
2852	"      gentleman left his cigar-ash. It is a white wooden gate with a"
2852	"      latch. Beyond it lies the wide moor. I remembered your theory of"
2852	"      the affair and tried to picture all that had occurred. As the old"
2852	"      man stood there he saw something coming across the moor,"
2852	"      something which terrified him so that he lost his wits and ran"
2852	"      and ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaustion. There was"
2852	"      the long, gloomy tunnel down which he fled. And from what? A"
2852	"      sheep-dog of the moor? Or a spectral hound, black, silent, and"
2852	"      monstrous? Was there a human agency in the matter? Did the pale,"
2852	"      watchful Barrymore know more than he cared to say? It was all dim"
2852	"      and vague, but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind"
2852	"      it."
2852	""
2852	"      One other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. This is Mr."
2852	"      Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who lives some four miles to the south"
2852	"      of us. He is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and"
2852	"      choleric. His passion is for the British law, and he has spent a"
2852	"      large fortune in litigation. He fights for the mere pleasure of"
2852	"      fighting and is equally ready to take up either side of a"
2852	"      question, so that it is no wonder that he has found it a costly"
2852	"      amusement. Sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy the"
2852	"      parish to make him open it. At others he will with his own hands"
2852	"      tear down some other man’s gate and declare that a path has"
2852	"      existed there from time immemorial, defying the owner to"
2852	"      prosecute him for trespass. He is learned in old manorial and"
2852	"      communal rights, and he applies his knowledge sometimes in favour"
2852	"      of the villagers of Fernworthy and sometimes against them, so"
2852	"      that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the"
2852	"      village street or else burned in effigy, according to his latest"
2852	"      exploit. He is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his hands"
2852	"      at present, which will probably swallow up the remainder of his"
2852	"      fortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the"
2852	"      future. Apart from the law he seems a kindly, good-natured"
2852	"      person, and I only mention him because you were particular that I"
2852	"      should send some description of the people who surround us. He is"
2852	"      curiously employed at present, for, being an amateur astronomer,"
2852	"      he has an excellent telescope, with which he lies upon the roof"
2852	"      of his own house and sweeps the moor all day in the hope of"
2852	"      catching a glimpse of the escaped convict. If he would confine"
2852	"      his energies to this all would be well, but there are rumours"
2852	"      that he intends to prosecute Dr. Mortimer for opening a grave"
2852	"      without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the"
2852	"      Neolithic skull in the barrow on Long Down. He helps to keep our"
2852	"      lives from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where"
2852	"      it is badly needed."
2852	""
2852	"      And now, having brought you up to date in the escaped convict,"
2852	"      the Stapletons, Dr. Mortimer, and Frankland, of Lafter Hall, let"
2852	"      me end on that which is most important and tell you more about"
2852	"      the Barrymores, and especially about the surprising development"
2852	"      of last night."
2852	""
2852	"      First of all about the test telegram, which you sent from London"
2852	"      in order to make sure that Barrymore was really here. I have"
2852	"      already explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that"
2852	"      the test was worthless and that we have no proof one way or the"
2852	"      other. I told Sir Henry how the matter stood, and he at once, in"
2852	"      his downright fashion, had Barrymore up and asked him whether he"
2852	"      had received the telegram himself. Barrymore said that he had."
2852	""
2852	"      “Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?” asked Sir Henry."
2852	""
2852	"      Barrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time."
2852	""
2852	"      “No,” said he, “I was in the box-room at the time, and my wife"
2852	"      brought it up to me.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Did you answer it yourself?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write"
2852	"      it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      In the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord."
2852	""
2852	"      “I could not quite understand the object of your questions this"
2852	"      morning, Sir Henry,” said he. “I trust that they do not mean that"
2852	"      I have done anything to forfeit your confidence?”"
2852	""
2852	"      Sir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by"
2852	"      giving him a considerable part of his old wardrobe, the London"
2852	"      outfit having now all arrived."
2852	""
2852	"      Mrs. Barrymore is of interest to me. She is a heavy, solid"
2852	"      person, very limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be"
2852	"      puritanical. You could hardly conceive a less emotional subject."
2852	"      Yet I have told you how, on the first night here, I heard her"
2852	"      sobbing bitterly, and since then I have more than once observed"
2852	"      traces of tears upon her face. Some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her"
2852	"      heart. Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty memory which haunts"
2852	"      her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a domestic"
2852	"      tyrant. I have always felt that there was something singular and"
2852	"      questionable in this man’s character, but the adventure of last"
2852	"      night brings all my suspicions to a head."
2852	""
2852	"      And yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You are aware that"
2852	"      I am not a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on guard in"
2852	"      this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night,"
2852	"      about two in the morning, I was aroused by a stealthy step"
2852	"      passing my room. I rose, opened my door, and peeped out. A long"
2852	"      black shadow was trailing down the corridor. It was thrown by a"
2852	"      man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his"
2852	"      hand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no covering to his feet."
2852	"      I could merely see the outline, but his height told me that it"
2852	"      was Barrymore. He walked very slowly and circumspectly, and there"
2852	"      was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole"
2852	"      appearance."
2852	""
2852	"      I have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which"
2852	"      runs round the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther"
2852	"      side. I waited until he had passed out of sight and then I"
2852	"      followed him. When I came round the balcony he had reached the"
2852	"      end of the farther corridor, and I could see from the glimmer of"
2852	"      light through an open door that he had entered one of the rooms."
2852	"      Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied so that his"
2852	"      expedition became more mysterious than ever. The light shone"
2852	"      steadily as if he were standing motionless. I crept down the"
2852	"      passage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner of"
2852	"      the door."
2852	""
2852	"      Barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held"
2852	"      against the glass. His profile was half turned towards me, and"
2852	"      his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out"
2852	"      into the blackness of the moor. For some minutes he stood"
2852	"      watching intently. Then he gave a deep groan and with an"
2852	"      impatient gesture he put out the light. Instantly I made my way"
2852	"      back to my room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing"
2852	"      once more upon their return journey. Long afterwards when I had"
2852	"      fallen into a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock,"
2852	"      but I could not tell whence the sound came. What it all means I"
2852	"      cannot guess, but there is some secret business going on in this"
2852	"      house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom"
2852	"      of. I do not trouble you with my theories, for you asked me to"
2852	"      furnish you only with facts. I have had a long talk with Sir"
2852	"      Henry this morning, and we have made a plan of campaign founded"
2852	"      upon my observations of last night. I will not speak about it"
2852	"      just now, but it should make my next report interesting reading."

2852	""
2852	""
2852	"      Baskerville Hall, Oct. 15th."
2852	""
2852	"      MY DEAR HOLMES,"
2852	""
2852	"      If I was compelled to leave you without much news during the"
2852	"      early days of my mission you must acknowledge that I am making up"
2852	"      for lost time, and that events are now crowding thick and fast"
2852	"      upon us. In my last report I ended upon my top note with"
2852	"      Barrymore at the window, and now I have quite a budget already"
2852	"      which will, unless I am much mistaken, considerably surprise you."
2852	"      Things have taken a turn which I could not have anticipated. In"
2852	"      some ways they have within the last forty-eight hours become much"
2852	"      clearer and in some ways they have become more complicated. But I"
2852	"      will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself."
2852	""
2852	"      Before breakfast on the morning following my adventure I went"
2852	"      down the corridor and examined the room in which Barrymore had"
2852	"      been on the night before. The western window through which he had"
2852	"      stared so intently has, I noticed, one peculiarity above all"
2852	"      other windows in the house—it commands the nearest outlook on to"
2852	"      the moor. There is an opening between two trees which enables one"
2852	"      from this point of view to look right down upon it, while from"
2852	"      all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse which can be"
2852	"      obtained. It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since only this"
2852	"      window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out for"
2852	"      something or somebody upon the moor. The night was very dark, so"
2852	"      that I can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone."
2852	"      It had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue was"
2852	"      on foot. That would have accounted for his stealthy movements and"
2852	"      also for the uneasiness of his wife. The man is a"
2852	"      striking-looking fellow, very well equipped to steal the heart of"
2852	"      a country girl, so that this theory seemed to have something to"
2852	"      support it. That opening of the door which I had heard after I"
2852	"      had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep"
2852	"      some clandestine appointment. So I reasoned with myself in the"
2852	"      morning, and I tell you the direction of my suspicions, however"
2852	"      much the result may have shown that they were unfounded."
2852	""
2852	"      But whatever the true explanation of Barrymore’s movements might"
2852	"      be, I felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself"
2852	"      until I could explain them was more than I could bear. I had an"
2852	"      interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast, and I"
2852	"      told him all that I had seen. He was less surprised than I had"
2852	"      expected."
2852	""
2852	"      “I knew that Barrymore walked about nights, and I had a mind to"
2852	"      speak to him about it,” said he. “Two or three times I have heard"
2852	"      his steps in the passage, coming and going, just about the hour"
2852	"      you name.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular"
2852	"      window,” I suggested."
2852	""
2852	"      “Perhaps he does. If so, we should be able to shadow him and see"
2852	"      what it is that he is after. I wonder what your friend Holmes"
2852	"      would do if he were here.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest,” said"
2852	"      I. “He would follow Barrymore and see what he did.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Then we shall do it together.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But surely he would hear us.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “The man is rather deaf, and in any case we must take our chance"
2852	"      of that. We’ll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he"
2852	"      passes.” Sir Henry rubbed his hands with pleasure, and it was"
2852	"      evident that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his somewhat"
2852	"      quiet life upon the moor."
2852	""
2852	"      The baronet has been in communication with the architect who"
2852	"      prepared the plans for Sir Charles, and with a contractor from"
2852	"      London, so that we may expect great changes to begin here soon."
2852	"      There have been decorators and furnishers up from Plymouth, and"
2852	"      it is evident that our friend has large ideas and means to spare"
2852	"      no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his family. When"
2852	"      the house is renovated and refurnished, all that he will need"
2852	"      will be a wife to make it complete. Between ourselves there are"
2852	"      pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is"
2852	"      willing, for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a"
2852	"      woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton."
2852	"      And yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as"
2852	"      one would under the circumstances expect. Today, for example, its"
2852	"      surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple, which has caused"
2852	"      our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance."
2852	""
2852	"      After the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir"
2852	"      Henry put on his hat and prepared to go out. As a matter of"
2852	"      course I did the same."
2852	""
2852	"      “What, are _you_ coming, Watson?” he asked, looking at me in a"
2852	"      curious way."
2852	""
2852	"      “That depends on whether you are going on the moor,” said I."
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, I am.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, you know what my instructions are. I am sorry to intrude,"
2852	"      but you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not"
2852	"      leave you, and especially that you should not go alone upon the"
2852	"      moor.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Sir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile."
2852	""
2852	"      “My dear fellow,” said he, “Holmes, with all his wisdom, did not"
2852	"      foresee some things which have happened since I have been on the"
2852	"      moor. You understand me? I am sure that you are the last man in"
2852	"      the world who would wish to be a spoil-sport. I must go out"
2852	"      alone.”"
2852	""
2852	"      It put me in a most awkward position. I was at a loss what to say"
2852	"      or what to do, and before I had made up my mind he picked up his"
2852	"      cane and was gone."
2852	""
2852	"      But when I came to think the matter over my conscience reproached"
2852	"      me bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my"
2852	"      sight. I imagined what my feelings would be if I had to return to"
2852	"      you and to confess that some misfortune had occurred through my"
2852	"      disregard for your instructions. I assure you my cheeks flushed"
2852	"      at the very thought. It might not even now be too late to"
2852	"      overtake him, so I set off at once in the direction of Merripit"
2852	"      House."
2852	""
2852	"      I hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing"
2852	"      anything of Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moor"
2852	"      path branches off. There, fearing that perhaps I had come in the"
2852	"      wrong direction after all, I mounted a hill from which I could"
2852	"      command a view—the same hill which is cut into the dark quarry."
2852	"      Thence I saw him at once. He was on the moor path about a quarter"
2852	"      of a mile off, and a lady was by his side who could only be Miss"
2852	"      Stapleton. It was clear that there was already an understanding"
2852	"      between them and that they had met by appointment. They were"
2852	"      walking slowly along in deep conversation, and I saw her making"
2852	"      quick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest"
2852	"      in what she was saying, while he listened intently, and once or"
2852	"      twice shook his head in strong dissent. I stood among the rocks"
2852	"      watching them, very much puzzled as to what I should do next. To"
2852	"      follow them and break into their intimate conversation seemed to"
2852	"      be an outrage, and yet my clear duty was never for an instant to"
2852	"      let him out of my sight. To act the spy upon a friend was a"
2852	"      hateful task. Still, I could see no better course than to observe"
2852	"      him from the hill, and to clear my conscience by confessing to"
2852	"      him afterwards what I had done. It is true that if any sudden"
2852	"      danger had threatened him I was too far away to be of use, and"
2852	"      yet I am sure that you will agree with me that the position was"
2852	"      very difficult, and that there was nothing more which I could do."
2852	""
2852	"      Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted on the path and"
2852	"      were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I was"
2852	"      suddenly aware that I was not the only witness of their"
2852	"      interview. A wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye, and"
2852	"      another glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a man"
2852	"      who was moving among the broken ground. It was Stapleton with his"
2852	"      butterfly-net. He was very much closer to the pair than I was,"
2852	"      and he appeared to be moving in their direction. At this instant"
2852	"      Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton to his side. His arm was"
2852	"      round her, but it seemed to me that she was straining away from"
2852	"      him with her face averted. He stooped his head to hers, and she"
2852	"      raised one hand as if in protest. Next moment I saw them spring"
2852	"      apart and turn hurriedly round. Stapleton was the cause of the"
2852	"      interruption. He was running wildly towards them, his absurd net"
2852	"      dangling behind him. He gesticulated and almost danced with"
2852	"      excitement in front of the lovers. What the scene meant I could"
2852	"      not imagine, but it seemed to me that Stapleton was abusing Sir"
2852	"      Henry, who offered explanations, which became more angry as the"
2852	"      other refused to accept them. The lady stood by in haughty"
2852	"      silence. Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in a"
2852	"      peremptory way to his sister, who, after an irresolute glance at"
2852	"      Sir Henry, walked off by the side of her brother. The"
2852	"      naturalist’s angry gestures showed that the lady was included in"
2852	"      his displeasure. The baronet stood for a minute looking after"
2852	"      them, and then he walked slowly back the way that he had come,"
2852	"      his head hanging, the very picture of dejection."
2852	""
2852	"      What all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed"
2852	"      to have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend’s"
2852	"      knowledge. I ran down the hill therefore and met the baronet at"
2852	"      the bottom. His face was flushed with anger and his brows were"
2852	"      wrinkled, like one who is at his wit’s ends what to do."
2852	""
2852	"      “Halloa, Watson! Where have you dropped from?” said he. “You"
2852	"      don’t mean to say that you came after me in spite of all?”"
2852	""
2852	"      I explained everything to him: how I had found it impossible to"
2852	"      remain behind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessed"
2852	"      all that had occurred. For an instant his eyes blazed at me, but"
2852	"      my frankness disarmed his anger, and he broke at last into a"
2852	"      rather rueful laugh."
2852	""
2852	"      “You would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe"
2852	"      place for a man to be private,” said he, “but, by thunder, the"
2852	"      whole countryside seems to have been out to see me do my"
2852	"      wooing—and a mighty poor wooing at that! Where had you engaged a"
2852	"      seat?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I was on that hill.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Quite in the back row, eh? But her brother was well up to the"
2852	"      front. Did you see him come out on us?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, I did.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Did he ever strike you as being crazy—this brother of hers?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I can’t say that he ever did.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I dare say not. I always thought him sane enough until today,"
2852	"      but you can take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a"
2852	"      straitjacket. What’s the matter with me, anyhow? You’ve lived"
2852	"      near me for some weeks, Watson. Tell me straight, now! Is there"
2852	"      anything that would prevent me from making a good husband to a"
2852	"      woman that I loved?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I should say not.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He can’t object to my worldly position, so it must be myself"
2852	"      that he has this down on. What has he against me? I never hurt"
2852	"      man or woman in my life that I know of. And yet he would not so"
2852	"      much as let me touch the tips of her fingers.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Did he say so?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I’ve only known her"
2852	"      these few weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made"
2852	"      for me, and she, too—she was happy when she was with me, and that"
2852	"      I’ll swear. There’s a light in a woman’s eyes that speaks louder"
2852	"      than words. But he has never let us get together and it was only"
2852	"      today for the first time that I saw a chance of having a few"
2852	"      words with her alone. She was glad to meet me, but when she did"
2852	"      it was not love that she would talk about, and she wouldn’t have"
2852	"      let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it. She"
2852	"      kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger, and that"
2852	"      she would never be happy until I had left it. I told her that"
2852	"      since I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if"
2852	"      she really wanted me to go, the only way to work it was for her"
2852	"      to arrange to go with me. With that I offered in as many words to"
2852	"      marry her, but before she could answer, down came this brother of"
2852	"      hers, running at us with a face on him like a madman. He was just"
2852	"      white with rage, and those light eyes of his were blazing with"
2852	"      fury. What was I doing with the lady? How dared I offer her"
2852	"      attentions which were distasteful to her? Did I think that"
2852	"      because I was a baronet I could do what I liked? If he had not"
2852	"      been her brother I should have known better how to answer him. As"
2852	"      it was I told him that my feelings towards his sister were such"
2852	"      as I was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that she might honour"
2852	"      me by becoming my wife. That seemed to make the matter no better,"
2852	"      so then I lost my temper too, and I answered him rather more"
2852	"      hotly than I should perhaps, considering that she was standing"
2852	"      by. So it ended by his going off with her, as you saw, and here"
2852	"      am I as badly puzzled a man as any in this county. Just tell me"
2852	"      what it all means, Watson, and I’ll owe you more than ever I can"
2852	"      hope to pay.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely"
2852	"      puzzled myself. Our friend’s title, his fortune, his age, his"
2852	"      character, and his appearance are all in his favour, and I know"
2852	"      nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which runs in his"
2852	"      family. That his advances should be rejected so brusquely without"
2852	"      any reference to the lady’s own wishes and that the lady should"
2852	"      accept the situation without protest is very amazing. However,"
2852	"      our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from Stapleton"
2852	"      himself that very afternoon. He had come to offer apologies for"
2852	"      his rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview"
2852	"      with Sir Henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was"
2852	"      that the breach is quite healed, and that we are to dine at"
2852	"      Merripit House next Friday as a sign of it."
2852	""
2852	"      “I don’t say now that he isn’t a crazy man,” said Sir Henry; “I"
2852	"      can’t forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning,"
2852	"      but I must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology"
2852	"      than he has done.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Did he give any explanation of his conduct?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “His sister is everything in his life, he says. That is natural"
2852	"      enough, and I am glad that he should understand her value. They"
2852	"      have always been together, and according to his account he has"
2852	"      been a very lonely man with only her as a companion, so that the"
2852	"      thought of losing her was really terrible to him. He had not"
2852	"      understood, he said, that I was becoming attached to her, but"
2852	"      when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so, and that she"
2852	"      might be taken away from him, it gave him such a shock that for a"
2852	"      time he was not responsible for what he said or did. He was very"
2852	"      sorry for all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish and"
2852	"      how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a"
2852	"      beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life. If"
2852	"      she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like"
2852	"      myself than to anyone else. But in any case it was a blow to him"
2852	"      and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself"
2852	"      to meet it. He would withdraw all opposition upon his part if I"
2852	"      would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be"
2852	"      content with cultivating the lady’s friendship during that time"
2852	"      without claiming her love. This I promised, and so the matter"
2852	"      rests.”"
2852	""
2852	"      So there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. It is"
2852	"      something to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we"
2852	"      are floundering. We know now why Stapleton looked with disfavour"
2852	"      upon his sister’s suitor—even when that suitor was so eligible a"
2852	"      one as Sir Henry. And now I pass on to another thread which I"
2852	"      have extricated out of the tangled skein, the mystery of the sobs"
2852	"      in the night, of the tear-stained face of Mrs. Barrymore, of the"
2852	"      secret journey of the butler to the western lattice window."
2852	"      Congratulate me, my dear Holmes, and tell me that I have not"
2852	"      disappointed you as an agent—that you do not regret the"
2852	"      confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down. All"
2852	"      these things have by one night’s work been thoroughly cleared."
2852	""
2852	"      I have said “by one night’s work,” but, in truth, it was by two"
2852	"      nights’ work, for on the first we drew entirely blank. I sat up"
2852	"      with Sir Henry in his rooms until nearly three o’clock in the"
2852	"      morning, but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming"
2852	"      clock upon the stairs. It was a most melancholy vigil and ended"
2852	"      by each of us falling asleep in our chairs. Fortunately we were"
2852	"      not discouraged, and we determined to try again. The next night"
2852	"      we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes without making the"
2852	"      least sound. It was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by,"
2852	"      and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient"
2852	"      interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into"
2852	"      which he hopes the game may wander. One struck, and two, and we"
2852	"      had almost for the second time given it up in despair when in an"
2852	"      instant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our weary"
2852	"      senses keenly on the alert once more. We had heard the creak of a"
2852	"      step in the passage."
2852	""
2852	"      Very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the"
2852	"      distance. Then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out"
2852	"      in pursuit. Already our man had gone round the gallery and the"
2852	"      corridor was all in darkness. Softly we stole along until we had"
2852	"      come into the other wing. We were just in time to catch a glimpse"
2852	"      of the tall, black-bearded figure, his shoulders rounded as he"
2852	"      tiptoed down the passage. Then he passed through the same door as"
2852	"      before, and the light of the candle framed it in the darkness and"
2852	"      shot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor. We"
2852	"      shuffled cautiously towards it, trying every plank before we"
2852	"      dared to put our whole weight upon it. We had taken the"
2852	"      precaution of leaving our boots behind us, but, even so, the old"
2852	"      boards snapped and creaked beneath our tread. Sometimes it seemed"
2852	"      impossible that he should fail to hear our approach. However, the"
2852	"      man is fortunately rather deaf, and he was entirely preoccupied"
2852	"      in that which he was doing. When at last we reached the door and"
2852	"      peeped through we found him crouching at the window, candle in"
2852	"      hand, his white, intent face pressed against the pane, exactly as"
2852	"      I had seen him two nights before."
2852	""
2852	"      We had arranged no plan of campaign, but the baronet is a man to"
2852	"      whom the most direct way is always the most natural. He walked"
2852	"      into the room, and as he did so Barrymore sprang up from the"
2852	"      window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood, livid and"
2852	"      trembling, before us. His dark eyes, glaring out of the white"
2852	"      mask of his face, were full of horror and astonishment as he"
2852	"      gazed from Sir Henry to me."
2852	""
2852	"      “What are you doing here, Barrymore?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Nothing, sir.” His agitation was so great that he could hardly"
2852	"      speak, and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his"
2852	"      candle. “It was the window, sir. I go round at night to see that"
2852	"      they are fastened.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “On the second floor?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, sir, all the windows.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Look here, Barrymore,” said Sir Henry sternly, “we have made up"
2852	"      our minds to have the truth out of you, so it will save you"
2852	"      trouble to tell it sooner rather than later. Come, now! No lies!"
2852	"      What were you doing at that window?”"
2852	""
2852	"      The fellow looked at us in a helpless way, and he wrung his hands"
2852	"      together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and"
2852	"      misery."
2852	""
2852	"      “I was doing no harm, sir. I was holding a candle to the window.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And why were you holding a candle to the window?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Don’t ask me, Sir Henry—don’t ask me! I give you my word, sir,"
2852	"      that it is not my secret, and that I cannot tell it. If it"
2852	"      concerned no one but myself I would not try to keep it from you.”"
2852	""
2852	"      A sudden idea occurred to me, and I took the candle from the"
2852	"      trembling hand of the butler."
2852	""
2852	"      “He must have been holding it as a signal,” said I. “Let us see"
2852	"      if there is any answer.” I held it as he had done, and stared out"
2852	"      into the darkness of the night. Vaguely I could discern the black"
2852	"      bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for the"
2852	"      moon was behind the clouds. And then I gave a cry of exultation,"
2852	"      for a tiny pinpoint of yellow light had suddenly transfixed the"
2852	"      dark veil, and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square"
2852	"      framed by the window."
2852	""
2852	"      “There it is!” I cried."
2852	""
2852	"      “No, no, sir, it is nothing—nothing at all!” the butler broke in;"
2852	"      “I assure you, sir—”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Move your light across the window, Watson!” cried the baronet."
2852	"      “See, the other moves also! Now, you rascal, do you deny that it"
2852	"      is a signal? Come, speak up! Who is your confederate out yonder,"
2852	"      and what is this conspiracy that is going on?”"
2852	""
2852	"      The man’s face became openly defiant. “It is my business, and not"
2852	"      yours. I will not tell.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Then you leave my employment right away.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Very good, sir. If I must I must.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And you go in disgrace. By thunder, you may well be ashamed of"
2852	"      yourself. Your family has lived with mine for over a hundred"
2852	"      years under this roof, and here I find you deep in some dark plot"
2852	"      against me.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, no, sir; no, not against you!” It was a woman’s voice, and"
2852	"      Mrs. Barrymore, paler and more horror-struck than her husband,"
2852	"      was standing at the door. Her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt"
2852	"      might have been comic were it not for the intensity of feeling"
2852	"      upon her face."
2852	""
2852	"      “We have to go, Eliza. This is the end of it. You can pack our"
2852	"      things,” said the butler."
2852	""
2852	"      “Oh, John, John, have I brought you to this? It is my doing, Sir"
2852	"      Henry—all mine. He has done nothing except for my sake and"
2852	"      because I asked him.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Speak out, then! What does it mean?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “My unhappy brother is starving on the moor. We cannot let him"
2852	"      perish at our very gates. The light is a signal to him that food"
2852	"      is ready for him, and his light out yonder is to show the spot to"
2852	"      which to bring it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Then your brother is—”"
2852	""
2852	"      “The escaped convict, sir—Selden, the criminal.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That’s the truth, sir,” said Barrymore. “I said that it was not"
2852	"      my secret and that I could not tell it to you. But now you have"
2852	"      heard it, and you will see that if there was a plot it was not"
2852	"      against you.”"
2852	""
2852	"      This, then, was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at"
2852	"      night and the light at the window. Sir Henry and I both stared at"
2852	"      the woman in amazement. Was it possible that this stolidly"
2852	"      respectable person was of the same blood as one of the most"
2852	"      notorious criminals in the country?"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, sir, my name was Selden, and he is my younger brother. We"
2852	"      humoured him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way"
2852	"      in everything until he came to think that the world was made for"
2852	"      his pleasure, and that he could do what he liked in it. Then as"
2852	"      he grew older he met wicked companions, and the devil entered"
2852	"      into him until he broke my mother’s heart and dragged our name in"
2852	"      the dirt. From crime to crime he sank lower and lower until it is"
2852	"      only the mercy of God which has snatched him from the scaffold;"
2852	"      but to me, sir, he was always the little curly-headed boy that I"
2852	"      had nursed and played with as an elder sister would. That was why"
2852	"      he broke prison, sir. He knew that I was here and that we could"
2852	"      not refuse to help him. When he dragged himself here one night,"
2852	"      weary and starving, with the warders hard at his heels, what"
2852	"      could we do? We took him in and fed him and cared for him. Then"
2852	"      you returned, sir, and my brother thought he would be safer on"
2852	"      the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry was over, so he"
2852	"      lay in hiding there. But every second night we made sure if he"
2852	"      was still there by putting a light in the window, and if there"
2852	"      was an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him."
2852	"      Every day we hoped that he was gone, but as long as he was there"
2852	"      we could not desert him. That is the whole truth, as I am an"
2852	"      honest Christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in"
2852	"      the matter it does not lie with my husband but with me, for whose"
2852	"      sake he has done all that he has.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The woman’s words came with an intense earnestness which carried"
2852	"      conviction with them."
2852	""
2852	"      “Is this true, Barrymore?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, Sir Henry. Every word of it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, I cannot blame you for standing by your own wife. Forget"
2852	"      what I have said. Go to your room, you two, and we shall talk"
2852	"      further about this matter in the morning.”"
2852	""
2852	"      When they were gone we looked out of the window again. Sir Henry"
2852	"      had flung it open, and the cold night wind beat in upon our"
2852	"      faces. Far away in the black distance there still glowed that one"
2852	"      tiny point of yellow light."
2852	""
2852	"      “I wonder he dares,” said Sir Henry."
2852	""
2852	"      “It may be so placed as to be only visible from here.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Very likely. How far do you think it is?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Out by the Cleft Tor, I think.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Not more than a mile or two off.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Hardly that.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, it cannot be far if Barrymore had to carry out the food to"
2852	"      it. And he is waiting, this villain, beside that candle. By"
2852	"      thunder, Watson, I am going out to take that man!”"
2852	""
2852	"      The same thought had crossed my own mind. It was not as if the"
2852	"      Barrymores had taken us into their confidence. Their secret had"
2852	"      been forced from them. The man was a danger to the community, an"
2852	"      unmitigated scoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse."
2852	"      We were only doing our duty in taking this chance of putting him"
2852	"      back where he could do no harm. With his brutal and violent"
2852	"      nature, others would have to pay the price if we held our hands."
2852	"      Any night, for example, our neighbours the Stapletons might be"
2852	"      attacked by him, and it may have been the thought of this which"
2852	"      made Sir Henry so keen upon the adventure."
2852	""
2852	"      “I will come,” said I."
2852	""
2852	"      “Then get your revolver and put on your boots. The sooner we"
2852	"      start the better, as the fellow may put out his light and be"
2852	"      off.”"
2852	""
2852	"      In five minutes we were outside the door, starting upon our"
2852	"      expedition. We hurried through the dark shrubbery, amid the dull"
2852	"      moaning of the autumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves."
2852	"      The night air was heavy with the smell of damp and decay. Now and"
2852	"      again the moon peeped out for an instant, but clouds were driving"
2852	"      over the face of the sky, and just as we came out on the moor a"
2852	"      thin rain began to fall. The light still burned steadily in"
2852	"      front."
2852	""
2852	"      “Are you armed?” I asked."
2852	""
2852	"      “I have a hunting-crop.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “We must close in on him rapidly, for he is said to be a"
2852	"      desperate fellow. We shall take him by surprise and have him at"
2852	"      our mercy before he can resist.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I say, Watson,” said the baronet, “what would Holmes say to"
2852	"      this? How about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil"
2852	"      is exalted?”"
2852	""
2852	"      As if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast"
2852	"      gloom of the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon"
2852	"      the borders of the great Grimpen Mire. It came with the wind"
2852	"      through the silence of the night, a long, deep mutter, then a"
2852	"      rising howl, and then the sad moan in which it died away. Again"
2852	"      and again it sounded, the whole air throbbing with it, strident,"
2852	"      wild, and menacing. The baronet caught my sleeve and his face"
2852	"      glimmered white through the darkness."
2852	""
2852	"      “My God, what’s that, Watson?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I don’t know. It’s a sound they have on the moor. I heard it"
2852	"      once before.”"
2852	""
2852	"      It died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us. We stood"
2852	"      straining our ears, but nothing came."
2852	""
2852	"      “Watson,” said the baronet, “it was the cry of a hound.”"
2852	""
2852	"      My blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a break in his voice"
2852	"      which told of the sudden horror which had seized him."
2852	""
2852	"      “What do they call this sound?” he asked."
2852	""
2852	"      “Who?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “The folk on the countryside.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Oh, they are ignorant people. Why should you mind what they call"
2852	"      it?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Tell me, Watson. What do they say of it?”"
2852	""
2852	"      I hesitated but could not escape the question."
2852	""
2852	"      “They say it is the cry of the Hound of the Baskervilles.”"
2852	""
2852	"      He groaned and was silent for a few moments."
2852	""
2852	"      “A hound it was,” he said at last, “but it seemed to come from"
2852	"      miles away, over yonder, I think.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It was hard to say whence it came.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It rose and fell with the wind. Isn’t that the direction of the"
2852	"      great Grimpen Mire?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, it is.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, it was up there. Come now, Watson, didn’t you think"
2852	"      yourself that it was the cry of a hound? I am not a child. You"
2852	"      need not fear to speak the truth.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Stapleton was with me when I heard it last. He said that it"
2852	"      might be the calling of a strange bird.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, no, it was a hound. My God, can there be some truth in all"
2852	"      these stories? Is it possible that I am really in danger from so"
2852	"      dark a cause? You don’t believe it, do you, Watson?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, no.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And yet it was one thing to laugh about it in London, and it is"
2852	"      another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear"
2852	"      such a cry as that. And my uncle! There was the footprint of the"
2852	"      hound beside him as he lay. It all fits together. I don’t think"
2852	"      that I am a coward, Watson, but that sound seemed to freeze my"
2852	"      very blood. Feel my hand!”"
2852	""
2852	"      It was as cold as a block of marble."
2852	""
2852	"      “You’ll be all right tomorrow.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I don’t think I’ll get that cry out of my head. What do you"
2852	"      advise that we do now?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Shall we turn back?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, by thunder; we have come out to get our man, and we will do"
2852	"      it. We after the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as not,"
2852	"      after us. Come on! We’ll see it through if all the fiends of the"
2852	"      pit were loose upon the moor.”"
2852	""
2852	"      We stumbled slowly along in the darkness, with the black loom of"
2852	"      the craggy hills around us, and the yellow speck of light burning"
2852	"      steadily in front. There is nothing so deceptive as the distance"
2852	"      of a light upon a pitch-dark night, and sometimes the glimmer"
2852	"      seemed to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might"
2852	"      have been within a few yards of us. But at last we could see"
2852	"      whence it came, and then we knew that we were indeed very close."
2852	"      A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which"
2852	"      flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also"
2852	"      to prevent it from being visible, save in the direction of"
2852	"      Baskerville Hall. A boulder of granite concealed our approach,"
2852	"      and crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light. It"
2852	"      was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle"
2852	"      of the moor, with no sign of life near it—just the one straight"
2852	"      yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it."
2852	""
2852	"      “What shall we do now?” whispered Sir Henry."
2852	""
2852	"      “Wait here. He must be near his light. Let us see if we can get a"
2852	"      glimpse of him.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him. Over"
2852	"      the rocks, in the crevice of which the candle burned, there was"
2852	"      thrust out an evil yellow face, a terrible animal face, all"
2852	"      seamed and scored with vile passions. Foul with mire, with a"
2852	"      bristling beard, and hung with matted hair, it might well have"
2852	"      belonged to one of those old savages who dwelt in the burrows on"
2852	"      the hillsides. The light beneath him was reflected in his small,"
2852	"      cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and left through the"
2852	"      darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard the steps"
2852	"      of the hunters."
2852	""
2852	"      Something had evidently aroused his suspicions. It may have been"
2852	"      that Barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to"
2852	"      give, or the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking"
2852	"      that all was not well, but I could read his fears upon his wicked"
2852	"      face. Any instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the"
2852	"      darkness. I sprang forward therefore, and Sir Henry did the same."
2852	"      At the same moment the convict screamed out a curse at us and"
2852	"      hurled a rock which splintered up against the boulder which had"
2852	"      sheltered us. I caught one glimpse of his short, squat, strongly"
2852	"      built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run. At the"
2852	"      same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds."
2852	"      We rushed over the brow of the hill, and there was our man"
2852	"      running with great speed down the other side, springing over the"
2852	"      stones in his way with the activity of a mountain goat. A lucky"
2852	"      long shot of my revolver might have crippled him, but I had"
2852	"      brought it only to defend myself if attacked and not to shoot an"
2852	"      unarmed man who was running away."
2852	""
2852	"      We were both swift runners and in fairly good training, but we"
2852	"      soon found that we had no chance of overtaking him. We saw him"
2852	"      for a long time in the moonlight until he was only a small speck"
2852	"      moving swiftly among the boulders upon the side of a distant"
2852	"      hill. We ran and ran until we were completely blown, but the"
2852	"      space between us grew ever wider. Finally we stopped and sat"
2852	"      panting on two rocks, while we watched him disappearing in the"
2852	"      distance."
2852	""
2852	"      And it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange and"
2852	"      unexpected thing. We had risen from our rocks and were turning to"
2852	"      go home, having abandoned the hopeless chase. The moon was low"
2852	"      upon the right, and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up"
2852	"      against the lower curve of its silver disc. There, outlined as"
2852	"      black as an ebony statue on that shining background, I saw the"
2852	"      figure of a man upon the tor. Do not think that it was a"
2852	"      delusion, Holmes. I assure you that I have never in my life seen"
2852	"      anything more clearly. As far as I could judge, the figure was"
2852	"      that of a tall, thin man. He stood with his legs a little"
2852	"      separated, his arms folded, his head bowed, as if he were"
2852	"      brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which"
2852	"      lay before him. He might have been the very spirit of that"
2852	"      terrible place. It was not the convict. This man was far from the"
2852	"      place where the latter had disappeared. Besides, he was a much"
2852	"      taller man. With a cry of surprise I pointed him out to the"
2852	"      baronet, but in the instant during which I had turned to grasp"
2852	"      his arm the man was gone. There was the sharp pinnacle of granite"
2852	"      still cutting the lower edge of the moon, but its peak bore no"
2852	"      trace of that silent and motionless figure."
2852	""
2852	"      I wished to go in that direction and to search the tor, but it"
2852	"      was some distance away. The baronet’s nerves were still quivering"
2852	"      from that cry, which recalled the dark story of his family, and"
2852	"      he was not in the mood for fresh adventures. He had not seen this"
2852	"      lonely man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which his"
2852	"      strange presence and his commanding attitude had given to me. “A"
2852	"      warder, no doubt,” said he. “The moor has been thick with them"
2852	"      since this fellow escaped.” Well, perhaps his explanation may be"
2852	"      the right one, but I should like to have some further proof of"
2852	"      it. Today we mean to communicate to the Princetown people where"
2852	"      they should look for their missing man, but it is hard lines that"
2852	"      we have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our"
2852	"      own prisoner. Such are the adventures of last night, and you must"
2852	"      acknowledge, my dear Holmes, that I have done you very well in"
2852	"      the matter of a report. Much of what I tell you is no doubt quite"
2852	"      irrelevant, but still I feel that it is best that I should let"
2852	"      you have all the facts and leave you to select for yourself those"
2852	"      which will be of most service to you in helping you to your"
2852	"      conclusions. We are certainly making some progress. So far as the"
2852	"      Barrymores go we have found the motive of their actions, and that"
2852	"      has cleared up the situation very much. But the moor with its"
2852	"      mysteries and its strange inhabitants remains as inscrutable as"
2852	"      ever. Perhaps in my next I may be able to throw some light upon"
2852	"      this also. Best of all would it be if you could come down to us."
2852	"      In any case you will hear from me again in the course of the next"
2852	"      few days."

2852	"Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson"
2852	""
2852	""
2852	"      So far I have been able to quote from the reports which I have"
2852	"      forwarded during these early days to Sherlock Holmes. Now,"
2852	"      however, I have arrived at a point in my narrative where I am"
2852	"      compelled to abandon this method and to trust once more to my"
2852	"      recollections, aided by the diary which I kept at the time. A few"
2852	"      extracts from the latter will carry me on to those scenes which"
2852	"      are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory. I proceed,"
2852	"      then, from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the"
2852	"      convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor."
2852	""
2852	"      _October_ 16_th_.—A dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain."
2852	"      The house is banked in with rolling clouds, which rise now and"
2852	"      then to show the dreary curves of the moor, with thin, silver"
2852	"      veins upon the sides of the hills, and the distant boulders"
2852	"      gleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces. It is"
2852	"      melancholy outside and in. The baronet is in a black reaction"
2852	"      after the excitements of the night. I am conscious myself of a"
2852	"      weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger—ever present"
2852	"      danger, which is the more terrible because I am unable to define"
2852	"      it."
2852	""
2852	"      And have I not cause for such a feeling? Consider the long"
2852	"      sequence of incidents which have all pointed to some sinister"
2852	"      influence which is at work around us. There is the death of the"
2852	"      last occupant of the Hall, fulfilling so exactly the conditions"
2852	"      of the family legend, and there are the repeated reports from"
2852	"      peasants of the appearance of a strange creature upon the moor."
2852	"      Twice I have with my own ears heard the sound which resembled the"
2852	"      distant baying of a hound. It is incredible, impossible, that it"
2852	"      should really be outside the ordinary laws of nature. A spectral"
2852	"      hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the air with its"
2852	"      howling is surely not to be thought of. Stapleton may fall in"
2852	"      with such a superstition, and Mortimer also, but if I have one"
2852	"      quality upon earth it is common sense, and nothing will persuade"
2852	"      me to believe in such a thing. To do so would be to descend to"
2852	"      the level of these poor peasants, who are not content with a mere"
2852	"      fiend dog but must needs describe him with hell-fire shooting"
2852	"      from his mouth and eyes. Holmes would not listen to such fancies,"
2852	"      and I am his agent. But facts are facts, and I have twice heard"
2852	"      this crying upon the moor. Suppose that there were really some"
2852	"      huge hound loose upon it; that would go far to explain"
2852	"      everything. But where could such a hound lie concealed, where did"
2852	"      it get its food, where did it come from, how was it that no one"
2852	"      saw it by day? It must be confessed that the natural explanation"
2852	"      offers almost as many difficulties as the other. And always,"
2852	"      apart from the hound, there is the fact of the human agency in"
2852	"      London, the man in the cab, and the letter which warned Sir Henry"
2852	"      against the moor. This at least was real, but it might have been"
2852	"      the work of a protecting friend as easily as of an enemy. Where"
2852	"      is that friend or enemy now? Has he remained in London, or has he"
2852	"      followed us down here? Could he—could he be the stranger whom I"
2852	"      saw upon the tor?"
2852	""
2852	"      It is true that I have had only the one glance at him, and yet"
2852	"      there are some things to which I am ready to swear. He is no one"
2852	"      whom I have seen down here, and I have now met all the"
2852	"      neighbours. The figure was far taller than that of Stapleton, far"
2852	"      thinner than that of Frankland. Barrymore it might possibly have"
2852	"      been, but we had left him behind us, and I am certain that he"
2852	"      could not have followed us. A stranger then is still dogging us,"
2852	"      just as a stranger dogged us in London. We have never shaken him"
2852	"      off. If I could lay my hands upon that man, then at last we might"
2852	"      find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties. To this one"
2852	"      purpose I must now devote all my energies."
2852	""
2852	"      My first impulse was to tell Sir Henry all my plans. My second"
2852	"      and wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as"
2852	"      possible to anyone. He is silent and distrait. His nerves have"
2852	"      been strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor. I will say"
2852	"      nothing to add to his anxieties, but I will take my own steps to"
2852	"      attain my own end."
2852	""
2852	"      We had a small scene this morning after breakfast. Barrymore"
2852	"      asked leave to speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted in"
2852	"      his study some little time. Sitting in the billiard-room I more"
2852	"      than once heard the sound of voices raised, and I had a pretty"
2852	"      good idea what the point was which was under discussion. After a"
2852	"      time the baronet opened his door and called for me. “Barrymore"
2852	"      considers that he has a grievance,” he said. “He thinks that it"
2852	"      was unfair on our part to hunt his brother-in-law down when he,"
2852	"      of his own free will, had told us the secret.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The butler was standing very pale but very collected before us."
2852	""
2852	"      “I may have spoken too warmly, sir,” said he, “and if I have, I"
2852	"      am sure that I beg your pardon. At the same time, I was very much"
2852	"      surprised when I heard you two gentlemen come back this morning"
2852	"      and learned that you had been chasing Selden. The poor fellow has"
2852	"      enough to fight against without my putting more upon his track.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “If you had told us of your own free will it would have been a"
2852	"      different thing,” said the baronet, “you only told us, or rather"
2852	"      your wife only told us, when it was forced from you and you could"
2852	"      not help yourself.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I didn’t think you would have taken advantage of it, Sir"
2852	"      Henry—indeed I didn’t.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “The man is a public danger. There are lonely houses scattered"
2852	"      over the moor, and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing. You"
2852	"      only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that. Look at Mr."
2852	"      Stapleton’s house, for example, with no one but himself to defend"
2852	"      it. There’s no safety for anyone until he is under lock and key.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He’ll break into no house, sir. I give you my solemn word upon"
2852	"      that. But he will never trouble anyone in this country again. I"
2852	"      assure you, Sir Henry, that in a very few days the necessary"
2852	"      arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to"
2852	"      South America. For God’s sake, sir, I beg of you not to let the"
2852	"      police know that he is still on the moor. They have given up the"
2852	"      chase there, and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for"
2852	"      him. You can’t tell on him without getting my wife and me into"
2852	"      trouble. I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “What do you say, Watson?”"
2852	""
2852	"      I shrugged my shoulders. “If he were safely out of the country it"
2852	"      would relieve the tax-payer of a burden.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But how about the chance of his holding someone up before he"
2852	"      goes?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He would not do anything so mad, sir. We have provided him with"
2852	"      all that he can want. To commit a crime would be to show where he"
2852	"      was hiding.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That is true,” said Sir Henry. “Well, Barrymore—”"
2852	""
2852	"      “God bless you, sir, and thank you from my heart! It would have"
2852	"      killed my poor wife had he been taken again.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson? But, after"
2852	"      what we have heard I don’t feel as if I could give the man up, so"
2852	"      there is an end of it. All right, Barrymore, you can go.”"
2852	""
2852	"      With a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he"
2852	"      hesitated and then came back."
2852	""
2852	"      “You’ve been so kind to us, sir, that I should like to do the"
2852	"      best I can for you in return. I know something, Sir Henry, and"
2852	"      perhaps I should have said it before, but it was long after the"
2852	"      inquest that I found it out. I’ve never breathed a word about it"
2852	"      yet to mortal man. It’s about poor Sir Charles’s death.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The baronet and I were both upon our feet. “Do you know how he"
2852	"      died?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, sir, I don’t know that.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “What then?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I know why he was at the gate at that hour. It was to meet a"
2852	"      woman.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “To meet a woman! He?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, sir.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And the woman’s name?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I can’t give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials."
2852	"      Her initials were L. L.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “How do you know this, Barrymore?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. He had"
2852	"      usually a great many letters, for he was a public man and well"
2852	"      known for his kind heart, so that everyone who was in trouble was"
2852	"      glad to turn to him. But that morning, as it chanced, there was"
2852	"      only this one letter, so I took the more notice of it. It was"
2852	"      from Coombe Tracey, and it was addressed in a woman’s hand.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would have"
2852	"      done had it not been for my wife. Only a few weeks ago she was"
2852	"      cleaning out Sir Charles’s study—it had never been touched since"
2852	"      his death—and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back"
2852	"      of the grate. The greater part of it was charred to pieces, but"
2852	"      one little slip, the end of a page, hung together, and the"
2852	"      writing could still be read, though it was grey on a black"
2852	"      ground. It seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the"
2852	"      letter and it said: ‘Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn"
2852	"      this letter, and be at the gate by ten o clock. Beneath it were"
2852	"      signed the initials L. L.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Have you got that slip?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, sir, it crumbled all to bits after we moved it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Had Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters. I should"
2852	"      not have noticed this one, only it happened to come alone.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And you have no idea who L. L. is?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, sir. No more than you have. But I expect if we could lay our"
2852	"      hands upon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles’s"
2852	"      death.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I cannot understand, Barrymore, how you came to conceal this"
2852	"      important information.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, sir, it was immediately after that our own trouble came to"
2852	"      us. And then again, sir, we were both of us very fond of Sir"
2852	"      Charles, as we well might be considering all that he has done for"
2852	"      us. To rake this up couldn’t help our poor master, and it’s well"
2852	"      to go carefully when there’s a lady in the case. Even the best of"
2852	"      us—”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You thought it might injure his reputation?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, sir, I thought no good could come of it. But now you have"
2852	"      been kind to us, and I feel as if it would be treating you"
2852	"      unfairly not to tell you all that I know about the matter.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Very good, Barrymore; you can go.” When the butler had left us"
2852	"      Sir Henry turned to me. “Well, Watson, what do you think of this"
2852	"      new light?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “So I think. But if we can only trace L. L. it should clear up"
2852	"      the whole business. We have gained that much. We know that there"
2852	"      is someone who has the facts if we can only find her. What do you"
2852	"      think we should do?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Let Holmes know all about it at once. It will give him the clue"
2852	"      for which he has been seeking. I am much mistaken if it does not"
2852	"      bring him down.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning’s"
2852	"      conversation for Holmes. It was evident to me that he had been"
2852	"      very busy of late, for the notes which I had from Baker Street"
2852	"      were few and short, with no comments upon the information which I"
2852	"      had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission. No doubt his"
2852	"      blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties. And yet this"
2852	"      new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his"
2852	"      interest. I wish that he were here."
2852	""
2852	"      _October_ 17_th_.—All day today the rain poured down, rustling on"
2852	"      the ivy and dripping from the eaves. I thought of the convict out"
2852	"      upon the bleak, cold, shelterless moor. Poor devil! Whatever his"
2852	"      crimes, he has suffered something to atone for them. And then I"
2852	"      thought of that other one—the face in the cab, the figure against"
2852	"      the moon. Was he also out in that deluged—the unseen watcher, the"
2852	"      man of darkness? In the evening I put on my waterproof and I"
2852	"      walked far upon the sodden moor, full of dark imaginings, the"
2852	"      rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears."
2852	"      God help those who wander into the great mire now, for even the"
2852	"      firm uplands are becoming a morass. I found the black tor upon"
2852	"      which I had seen the solitary watcher, and from its craggy summit"
2852	"      I looked out myself across the melancholy downs. Rain squalls"
2852	"      drifted across their russet face, and the heavy, slate-coloured"
2852	"      clouds hung low over the landscape, trailing in grey wreaths down"
2852	"      the sides of the fantastic hills. In the distant hollow on the"
2852	"      left, half hidden by the mist, the two thin towers of Baskerville"
2852	"      Hall rose above the trees. They were the only signs of human life"
2852	"      which I could see, save only those prehistoric huts which lay"
2852	"      thickly upon the slopes of the hills. Nowhere was there any trace"
2852	"      of that lonely man whom I had seen on the same spot two nights"
2852	"      before."
2852	""
2852	"      As I walked back I was overtaken by Dr. Mortimer driving in his"
2852	"      dog-cart over a rough moorland track which led from the outlying"
2852	"      farmhouse of Foulmire. He has been very attentive to us, and"
2852	"      hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the Hall to see"
2852	"      how we were getting on. He insisted upon my climbing into his"
2852	"      dog-cart, and he gave me a lift homeward. I found him much"
2852	"      troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel. It had"
2852	"      wandered on to the moor and had never come back. I gave him such"
2852	"      consolation as I might, but I thought of the pony on the Grimpen"
2852	"      Mire, and I do not fancy that he will see his little dog again."
2852	""
2852	"      “By the way, Mortimer,” said I as we jolted along the rough road,"
2852	"      “I suppose there are few people living within driving distance of"
2852	"      this whom you do not know?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Hardly any, I think.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Can you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose initials are"
2852	"      L. L.?”"
2852	""
2852	"      He thought for a few minutes."
2852	""
2852	"      “No,” said he. “There are a few gipsies and labouring folk for"
2852	"      whom I can’t answer, but among the farmers or gentry there is no"
2852	"      one whose initials are those. Wait a bit though,” he added after"
2852	"      a pause. “There is Laura Lyons—her initials are L. L.—but she"
2852	"      lives in Coombe Tracey.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Who is she?” I asked."
2852	""
2852	"      “She is Frankland’s daughter.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “What! Old Frankland the crank?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Exactly. She married an artist named Lyons, who came sketching"
2852	"      on the moor. He proved to be a blackguard and deserted her. The"
2852	"      fault from what I hear may not have been entirely on one side."
2852	"      Her father refused to have anything to do with her because she"
2852	"      had married without his consent and perhaps for one or two other"
2852	"      reasons as well. So, between the old sinner and the young one the"
2852	"      girl has had a pretty bad time.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “How does she live?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot be"
2852	"      more, for his own affairs are considerably involved. Whatever she"
2852	"      may have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the"
2852	"      bad. Her story got about, and several of the people here did"
2852	"      something to enable her to earn an honest living. Stapleton did"
2852	"      for one, and Sir Charles for another. I gave a trifle myself. It"
2852	"      was to set her up in a typewriting business.”"
2852	""
2852	"      He wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but I managed to"
2852	"      satisfy his curiosity without telling him too much, for there is"
2852	"      no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence. Tomorrow"
2852	"      morning I shall find my way to Coombe Tracey, and if I can see"
2852	"      this Mrs. Laura Lyons, of equivocal reputation, a long step will"
2852	"      have been made towards clearing one incident in this chain of"
2852	"      mysteries. I am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent,"
2852	"      for when Mortimer pressed his questions to an inconvenient extent"
2852	"      I asked him casually to what type Frankland’s skull belonged, and"
2852	"      so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive. I have"
2852	"      not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing."
2852	""
2852	"      I have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous"
2852	"      and melancholy day. This was my conversation with Barrymore just"
2852	"      now, which gives me one more strong card which I can play in due"
2852	"      time."
2852	""
2852	"      Mortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and the baronet played"
2852	"      écarté afterwards. The butler brought me my coffee into the"
2852	"      library, and I took the chance to ask him a few questions."
2852	""
2852	"      “Well,” said I, “has this precious relation of yours departed, or"
2852	"      is he still lurking out yonder?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I don’t know, sir. I hope to heaven that he has gone, for he has"
2852	"      brought nothing but trouble here! I’ve not heard of him since I"
2852	"      left out food for him last, and that was three days ago.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Did you see him then?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Then he was certainly there?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “So you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who took"
2852	"      it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared at"
2852	"      Barrymore."
2852	""
2852	"      “You know that there is another man then?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, sir; there is another man upon the moor.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Have you seen him?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, sir.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “How do you know of him then?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Selden told me of him, sir, a week ago or more. He’s in hiding,"
2852	"      too, but he’s not a convict as far as I can make out. I don’t"
2852	"      like it, Dr. Watson—I tell you straight, sir, that I don’t like"
2852	"      it.” He spoke with a sudden passion of earnestness."
2852	""
2852	"      “Now, listen to me, Barrymore! I have no interest in this matter"
2852	"      but that of your master. I have come here with no object except"
2852	"      to help him. Tell me, frankly, what it is that you don’t like.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Barrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he regretted his outburst"
2852	"      or found it difficult to express his own feelings in words."
2852	""
2852	"      “It’s all these goings-on, sir,” he cried at last, waving his"
2852	"      hand towards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor."
2852	"      “There’s foul play somewhere, and there’s black villainy brewing,"
2852	"      to that I’ll swear! Very glad I should be, sir, to see Sir Henry"
2852	"      on his way back to London again!”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But what is it that alarms you?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Look at Sir Charles’s death! That was bad enough, for all that"
2852	"      the coroner said. Look at the noises on the moor at night."
2852	"      There’s not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for"
2852	"      it. Look at this stranger hiding out yonder, and watching and"
2852	"      waiting! What’s he waiting for? What does it mean? It means no"
2852	"      good to anyone of the name of Baskerville, and very glad I shall"
2852	"      be to be quit of it all on the day that Sir Henry’s new servants"
2852	"      are ready to take over the Hall.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But about this stranger,” said I. “Can you tell me anything"
2852	"      about him? What did Selden say? Did he find out where he hid, or"
2852	"      what he was doing?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one and gives nothing"
2852	"      away. At first he thought that he was the police, but soon he"
2852	"      found that he had some lay of his own. A kind of gentleman he"
2852	"      was, as far as he could see, but what he was doing he could not"
2852	"      make out.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And where did he say that he lived?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Among the old houses on the hillside—the stone huts where the"
2852	"      old folk used to live.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But how about his food?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and"
2852	"      brings all he needs. I dare say he goes to Coombe Tracey for what"
2852	"      he wants.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Very good, Barrymore. We may talk further of this some other"
2852	"      time.” When the butler had gone I walked over to the black"
2852	"      window, and I looked through a blurred pane at the driving clouds"
2852	"      and at the tossing outline of the wind-swept trees. It is a wild"
2852	"      night indoors, and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor."
2852	"      What passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in"
2852	"      such a place at such a time! And what deep and earnest purpose"
2852	"      can he have which calls for such a trial! There, in that hut upon"
2852	"      the moor, seems to lie the very centre of that problem which has"
2852	"      vexed me so sorely. I swear that another day shall not have"
2852	"      passed before I have done all that man can do to reach the heart"
2852	"      of the mystery."

2852	"The Man on the Tor"
2852	""
2852	""
2852	"      The extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter"
2852	"      has brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of October, a time"
2852	"      when these strange events began to move swiftly towards their"
2852	"      terrible conclusion. The incidents of the next few days are"
2852	"      indelibly graven upon my recollection, and I can tell them"
2852	"      without reference to the notes made at the time. I start them"
2852	"      from the day which succeeded that upon which I had established"
2852	"      two facts of great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura Lyons of"
2852	"      Coombe Tracey had written to Sir Charles Baskerville and made an"
2852	"      appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his"
2852	"      death, the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be"
2852	"      found among the stone huts upon the hillside. With these two"
2852	"      facts in my possession I felt that either my intelligence or my"
2852	"      courage must be deficient if I could not throw some further light"
2852	"      upon these dark places."
2852	""
2852	"      I had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I had learned about"
2852	"      Mrs. Lyons upon the evening before, for Dr. Mortimer remained"
2852	"      with him at cards until it was very late. At breakfast, however,"
2852	"      I informed him about my discovery and asked him whether he would"
2852	"      care to accompany me to Coombe Tracey. At first he was very eager"
2852	"      to come, but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if I"
2852	"      went alone the results might be better. The more formal we made"
2852	"      the visit the less information we might obtain. I left Sir Henry"
2852	"      behind, therefore, not without some prickings of conscience, and"
2852	"      drove off upon my new quest."
2852	""
2852	"      When I reached Coombe Tracey I told Perkins to put up the horses,"
2852	"      and I made inquiries for the lady whom I had come to interrogate."
2852	"      I had no difficulty in finding her rooms, which were central and"
2852	"      well appointed. A maid showed me in without ceremony, and as I"
2852	"      entered the sitting-room a lady, who was sitting before a"
2852	"      Remington typewriter, sprang up with a pleasant smile of welcome."
2852	"      Her face fell, however, when she saw that I was a stranger, and"
2852	"      she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit."
2852	""
2852	"      The first impression left by Mrs. Lyons was one of extreme"
2852	"      beauty. Her eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour, and"
2852	"      her cheeks, though considerably freckled, were flushed with the"
2852	"      exquisite bloom of the brunette, the dainty pink which lurks at"
2852	"      the heart of the sulphur rose. Admiration was, I repeat, the"
2852	"      first impression. But the second was criticism. There was"
2852	"      something subtly wrong with the face, some coarseness of"
2852	"      expression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness of lip"
2852	"      which marred its perfect beauty. But these, of course, are"
2852	"      afterthoughts. At the moment I was simply conscious that I was in"
2852	"      the presence of a very handsome woman, and that she was asking me"
2852	"      the reasons for my visit. I had not quite understood until that"
2852	"      instant how delicate my mission was."
2852	""
2852	"      “I have the pleasure,” said I, “of knowing your father.”"
2852	""
2852	"      It was a clumsy introduction, and the lady made me feel it."
2852	"      “There is nothing in common between my father and me,” she said."
2852	"      “I owe him nothing, and his friends are not mine. If it were not"
2852	"      for the late Sir Charles Baskerville and some other kind hearts I"
2852	"      might have starved for all that my father cared.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come"
2852	"      here to see you.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The freckles started out on the lady’s face."
2852	""
2852	"      “What can I tell you about him?” she asked, and her fingers"
2852	"      played nervously over the stops of her typewriter."
2852	""
2852	"      “You knew him, did you not?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I have already said that I owe a great deal to his kindness. If"
2852	"      I am able to support myself it is largely due to the interest"
2852	"      which he took in my unhappy situation.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Did you correspond with him?”"
2852	""
2852	"      The lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes."
2852	""
2852	"      “What is the object of these questions?” she asked sharply."
2852	""
2852	"      “The object is to avoid a public scandal. It is better that I"
2852	"      should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our"
2852	"      control.”"
2852	""
2852	"      She was silent and her face was still very pale. At last she"
2852	"      looked up with something reckless and defiant in her manner."
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, I’ll answer,” she said. “What are your questions?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Did you correspond with Sir Charles?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his"
2852	"      delicacy and his generosity.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Have you the dates of those letters?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Have you ever met him?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, once or twice, when he came into Coombe Tracey. He was a"
2852	"      very retiring man, and he preferred to do good by stealth.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he"
2852	"      know enough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say"
2852	"      that he has done?”"
2852	""
2852	"      She met my difficulty with the utmost readiness."
2852	""
2852	"      “There were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united"
2852	"      to help me. One was Mr. Stapleton, a neighbour and intimate"
2852	"      friend of Sir Charles’s. He was exceedingly kind, and it was"
2852	"      through him that Sir Charles learned about my affairs.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton"
2852	"      his almoner upon several occasions, so the lady’s statement bore"
2852	"      the impress of truth upon it."
2852	""
2852	"      “Did you ever write to Sir Charles asking him to meet you?” I"
2852	"      continued."
2852	""
2852	"      Mrs. Lyons flushed with anger again. “Really, sir, this is a very"
2852	"      extraordinary question.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I am sorry, madam, but I must repeat it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Then I answer, certainly not.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Not on the very day of Sir Charles’s death?”"
2852	""
2852	"      The flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly face was before"
2852	"      me. Her dry lips could not speak the “No” which I saw rather than"
2852	"      heard."
2852	""
2852	"      “Surely your memory deceives you,” said I. “I could even quote a"
2852	"      passage of your letter. It ran ‘Please, please, as you are a"
2852	"      gentleman, burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o’clock.’”"
2852	""
2852	"      I thought that she had fainted, but she recovered herself by a"
2852	"      supreme effort."
2852	""
2852	"      “Is there no such thing as a gentleman?” she gasped."
2852	""
2852	"      “You do Sir Charles an injustice. He _did_ burn the letter. But"
2852	"      sometimes a letter may be legible even when burned. You"
2852	"      acknowledge now that you wrote it?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, I did write it,” she cried, pouring out her soul in a"
2852	"      torrent of words. “I did write it. Why should I deny it? I have"
2852	"      no reason to be ashamed of it. I wished him to help me. I"
2852	"      believed that if I had an interview I could gain his help, so I"
2852	"      asked him to meet me.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But why at such an hour?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Because I had only just learned that he was going to London next"
2852	"      day and might be away for months. There were reasons why I could"
2852	"      not get there earlier.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the"
2852	"      house?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor’s"
2852	"      house?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, what happened when you did get there?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I never went.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Mrs. Lyons!”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, I swear it to you on all I hold sacred. I never went."
2852	"      Something intervened to prevent my going.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “What was that?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That is a private matter. I cannot tell it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You acknowledge then that you made an appointment with Sir"
2852	"      Charles at the very hour and place at which he met his death, but"
2852	"      you deny that you kept the appointment.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That is the truth.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Again and again I cross-questioned her, but I could never get"
2852	"      past that point."
2852	""
2852	"      “Mrs. Lyons,” said I as I rose from this long and inconclusive"
2852	"      interview, “you are taking a very great responsibility and"
2852	"      putting yourself in a very false position by not making an"
2852	"      absolutely clean breast of all that you know. If I have to call"
2852	"      in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are"
2852	"      compromised. If your position is innocent, why did you in the"
2852	"      first instance deny having written to Sir Charles upon that"
2852	"      date?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Because I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from"
2852	"      it and that I might find myself involved in a scandal.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy"
2852	"      your letter?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “If you have read the letter you will know.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I did not say that I had read all the letter.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You quoted some of it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I quoted the postscript. The letter had, as I said, been burned"
2852	"      and it was not all legible. I ask you once again why it was that"
2852	"      you were so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter"
2852	"      which he received on the day of his death.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “The matter is a very private one.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “The more reason why you should avoid a public investigation.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I will tell you, then. If you have heard anything of my unhappy"
2852	"      history you will know that I made a rash marriage and had reason"
2852	"      to regret it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I have heard so much.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “My life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom I"
2852	"      abhor. The law is upon his side, and every day I am faced by the"
2852	"      possibility that he may force me to live with him. At the time"
2852	"      that I wrote this letter to Sir Charles I had learned that there"
2852	"      was a prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses"
2852	"      could be met. It meant everything to me—peace of mind, happiness,"
2852	"      self-respect—everything. I knew Sir Charles’s generosity, and I"
2852	"      thought that if he heard the story from my own lips he would help"
2852	"      me.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Then how is it that you did not go?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Because I received help in the interval from another source.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Why then, did you not write to Sir Charles and explain this?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “So I should have done had I not seen his death in the paper next"
2852	"      morning.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The woman’s story hung coherently together, and all my questions"
2852	"      were unable to shake it. I could only check it by finding if she"
2852	"      had, indeed, instituted divorce proceedings against her husband"
2852	"      at or about the time of the tragedy."
2852	""
2852	"      It was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been"
2852	"      to Baskerville Hall if she really had been, for a trap would be"
2852	"      necessary to take her there, and could not have returned to"
2852	"      Coombe Tracey until the early hours of the morning. Such an"
2852	"      excursion could not be kept secret. The probability was,"
2852	"      therefore, that she was telling the truth, or, at least, a part"
2852	"      of the truth. I came away baffled and disheartened. Once again I"
2852	"      had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every"
2852	"      path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission. And yet"
2852	"      the more I thought of the lady’s face and of her manner the more"
2852	"      I felt that something was being held back from me. Why should she"
2852	"      turn so pale? Why should she fight against every admission until"
2852	"      it was forced from her? Why should she have been so reticent at"
2852	"      the time of the tragedy? Surely the explanation of all this could"
2852	"      not be as innocent as she would have me believe. For the moment I"
2852	"      could proceed no farther in that direction, but must turn back to"
2852	"      that other clue which was to be sought for among the stone huts"
2852	"      upon the moor."
2852	""
2852	"      And that was a most vague direction. I realised it as I drove"
2852	"      back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient"
2852	"      people. Barrymore’s only indication had been that the stranger"
2852	"      lived in one of these abandoned huts, and many hundreds of them"
2852	"      are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the moor. But"
2852	"      I had my own experience for a guide since it had shown me the man"
2852	"      himself standing upon the summit of the Black Tor. That, then,"
2852	"      should be the centre of my search. From there I should explore"
2852	"      every hut upon the moor until I lighted upon the right one. If"
2852	"      this man were inside it I should find out from his own lips, at"
2852	"      the point of my revolver if necessary, who he was and why he had"
2852	"      dogged us so long. He might slip away from us in the crowd of"
2852	"      Regent Street, but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely"
2852	"      moor. On the other hand, if I should find the hut and its tenant"
2852	"      should not be within it I must remain there, however long the"
2852	"      vigil, until he returned. Holmes had missed him in London. It"
2852	"      would indeed be a triumph for me if I could run him to earth"
2852	"      where my master had failed."
2852	""
2852	"      Luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry, but now"
2852	"      at last it came to my aid. And the messenger of good fortune was"
2852	"      none other than Mr. Frankland, who was standing, grey-whiskered"
2852	"      and red-faced, outside the gate of his garden, which opened on to"
2852	"      the highroad along which I travelled."
2852	""
2852	"      “Good-day, Dr. Watson,” cried he with unwonted good humour, “you"
2852	"      must really give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass"
2852	"      of wine and to congratulate me.”"
2852	""
2852	"      My feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after"
2852	"      what I had heard of his treatment of his daughter, but I was"
2852	"      anxious to send Perkins and the wagonette home, and the"
2852	"      opportunity was a good one. I alighted and sent a message to Sir"
2852	"      Henry that I should walk over in time for dinner. Then I followed"
2852	"      Frankland into his dining-room."
2852	""
2852	"      “It is a great day for me, sir—one of the red-letter days of my"
2852	"      life,” he cried with many chuckles. “I have brought off a double"
2852	"      event. I mean to teach them in these parts that law is law, and"
2852	"      that there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it. I have"
2852	"      established a right of way through the centre of old Middleton’s"
2852	"      park, slap across it, sir, within a hundred yards of his own"
2852	"      front door. What do you think of that? We’ll teach these magnates"
2852	"      that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights of the commoners,"
2852	"      confound them! And I’ve closed the wood where the Fernworthy folk"
2852	"      used to picnic. These infernal people seem to think that there"
2852	"      are no rights of property, and that they can swarm where they"
2852	"      like with their papers and their bottles. Both cases decided, Dr."
2852	"      Watson, and both in my favour. I haven’t had such a day since I"
2852	"      had Sir John Morland for trespass because he shot in his own"
2852	"      warren.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “How on earth did you do that?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Look it up in the books, sir. It will repay reading—Frankland"
2852	"      _v_. Morland, Court of Queen’s Bench. It cost me £200, but I got"
2852	"      my verdict.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Did it do you any good?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “None, sir, none. I am proud to say that I had no interest in the"
2852	"      matter. I act entirely from a sense of public duty. I have no"
2852	"      doubt, for example, that the Fernworthy people will burn me in"
2852	"      effigy tonight. I told the police last time they did it that they"
2852	"      should stop these disgraceful exhibitions. The County"
2852	"      Constabulary is in a scandalous state, sir, and it has not"
2852	"      afforded me the protection to which I am entitled. The case of"
2852	"      Frankland _v_. Regina will bring the matter before the attention"
2852	"      of the public. I told them that they would have occasion to"
2852	"      regret their treatment of me, and already my words have come"
2852	"      true.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “How so?” I asked."
2852	""
2852	"      The old man put on a very knowing expression. “Because I could"
2852	"      tell them what they are dying to know; but nothing would induce"
2852	"      me to help the rascals in any way.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I had been casting round for some excuse by which I could get"
2852	"      away from his gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of it."
2852	"      I had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to"
2852	"      understand that any strong sign of interest would be the surest"
2852	"      way to stop his confidences."
2852	""
2852	"      “Some poaching case, no doubt?” said I with an indifferent"
2852	"      manner."
2852	""
2852	"      “Ha, ha, my boy, a very much more important matter than that!"
2852	"      What about the convict on the moor?”"
2852	""
2852	"      I stared. “You don’t mean that you know where he is?” said I."
2852	""
2852	"      “I may not know exactly where he is, but I am quite sure that I"
2852	"      could help the police to lay their hands on him. Has it never"
2852	"      struck you that the way to catch that man was to find out where"
2852	"      he got his food and so trace it to him?”"
2852	""
2852	"      He certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth."
2852	"      “No doubt,” said I; “but how do you know that he is anywhere upon"
2852	"      the moor?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I know it because I have seen with my own eyes the messenger who"
2852	"      takes him his food.”"
2852	""
2852	"      My heart sank for Barrymore. It was a serious thing to be in the"
2852	"      power of this spiteful old busybody. But his next remark took a"
2852	"      weight from my mind."
2852	""
2852	"      “You’ll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a"
2852	"      child. I see him every day through my telescope upon the roof. He"
2852	"      passes along the same path at the same hour, and to whom should"
2852	"      he be going except to the convict?”"
2852	""
2852	"      Here was luck indeed! And yet I suppressed all appearance of"
2852	"      interest. A child! Barrymore had said that our unknown was"
2852	"      supplied by a boy. It was on his track, and not upon the"
2852	"      convict’s, that Frankland had stumbled. If I could get his"
2852	"      knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt. But incredulity"
2852	"      and indifference were evidently my strongest cards."
2852	""
2852	"      “I should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of"
2852	"      one of the moorland shepherds taking out his father’s dinner.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old"
2852	"      autocrat. His eyes looked malignantly at me, and his grey"
2852	"      whiskers bristled like those of an angry cat."
2852	""
2852	"      “Indeed, sir!” said he, pointing out over the wide-stretching"
2852	"      moor. “Do you see that Black Tor over yonder? Well, do you see"
2852	"      the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it? It is the"
2852	"      stoniest part of the whole moor. Is that a place where a shepherd"
2852	"      would be likely to take his station? Your suggestion, sir, is a"
2852	"      most absurd one.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I meekly answered that I had spoken without knowing all the"
2852	"      facts. My submission pleased him and led him to further"
2852	"      confidences."
2852	""
2852	"      “You may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before I"
2852	"      come to an opinion. I have seen the boy again and again with his"
2852	"      bundle. Every day, and sometimes twice a day, I have been"
2852	"      able—but wait a moment, Dr. Watson. Do my eyes deceive me, or is"
2852	"      there at the present moment something moving upon that hillside?”"
2852	""
2852	"      It was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark"
2852	"      dot against the dull green and grey."
2852	""
2852	"      “Come, sir, come!” cried Frankland, rushing upstairs. “You will"
2852	"      see with your own eyes and judge for yourself.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod,"
2852	"      stood upon the flat leads of the house. Frankland clapped his eye"
2852	"      to it and gave a cry of satisfaction."
2852	""
2852	"      “Quick, Dr. Watson, quick, before he passes over the hill!”"
2852	""
2852	"      There he was, sure enough, a small urchin with a little bundle"
2852	"      upon his shoulder, toiling slowly up the hill. When he reached"
2852	"      the crest I saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant"
2852	"      against the cold blue sky. He looked round him with a furtive and"
2852	"      stealthy air, as one who dreads pursuit. Then he vanished over"
2852	"      the hill."
2852	""
2852	"      “Well! Am I right?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Certainly, there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And what the errand is even a county constable could guess. But"
2852	"      not one word shall they have from me, and I bind you to secrecy"
2852	"      also, Dr. Watson. Not a word! You understand!”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Just as you wish.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “They have treated me shamefully—shamefully. When the facts come"
2852	"      out in Frankland _v_. Regina I venture to think that a thrill of"
2852	"      indignation will run through the country. Nothing would induce me"
2852	"      to help the police in any way. For all they cared it might have"
2852	"      been me, instead of my effigy, which these rascals burned at the"
2852	"      stake. Surely you are not going! You will help me to empty the"
2852	"      decanter in honour of this great occasion!”"
2852	""
2852	"      But I resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading"
2852	"      him from his announced intention of walking home with me. I kept"
2852	"      the road as long as his eye was on me, and then I struck off"
2852	"      across the moor and made for the stony hill over which the boy"
2852	"      had disappeared. Everything was working in my favour, and I swore"
2852	"      that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that"
2852	"      I should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way."
2852	""
2852	"      The sun was already sinking when I reached the summit of the"
2852	"      hill, and the long slopes beneath me were all golden-green on one"
2852	"      side and grey shadow on the other. A haze lay low upon the"
2852	"      farthest sky-line, out of which jutted the fantastic shapes of"
2852	"      Belliver and Vixen Tor. Over the wide expanse there was no sound"
2852	"      and no movement. One great grey bird, a gull or curlew, soared"
2852	"      aloft in the blue heaven. He and I seemed to be the only living"
2852	"      things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath"
2852	"      it. The barren scene, the sense of loneliness, and the mystery"
2852	"      and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart. The boy"
2852	"      was nowhere to be seen. But down beneath me in a cleft of the"
2852	"      hills there was a circle of the old stone huts, and in the middle"
2852	"      of them there was one which retained sufficient roof to act as a"
2852	"      screen against the weather. My heart leaped within me as I saw"
2852	"      it. This must be the burrow where the stranger lurked. At last my"
2852	"      foot was on the threshold of his hiding place—his secret was"
2852	"      within my grasp."
2852	""
2852	"      As I approached the hut, walking as warily as Stapleton would do"
2852	"      when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, I"
2852	"      satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as a"
2852	"      habitation. A vague pathway among the boulders led to the"
2852	"      dilapidated opening which served as a door. All was silent"
2852	"      within. The unknown might be lurking there, or he might be"
2852	"      prowling on the moor. My nerves tingled with the sense of"
2852	"      adventure. Throwing aside my cigarette, I closed my hand upon the"
2852	"      butt of my revolver and, walking swiftly up to the door, I looked"
2852	"      in. The place was empty."
2852	""
2852	"      But there were ample signs that I had not come upon a false"
2852	"      scent. This was certainly where the man lived. Some blankets"
2852	"      rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which"
2852	"      Neolithic man had once slumbered. The ashes of a fire were heaped"
2852	"      in a rude grate. Beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket"
2852	"      half-full of water. A litter of empty tins showed that the place"
2852	"      had been occupied for some time, and I saw, as my eyes became"
2852	"      accustomed to the checkered light, a pannikin and a half-full"
2852	"      bottle of spirits standing in the corner. In the middle of the"
2852	"      hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table, and upon this"
2852	"      stood a small cloth bundle—the same, no doubt, which I had seen"
2852	"      through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy. It contained"
2852	"      a loaf of bread, a tinned tongue, and two tins of preserved"
2852	"      peaches. As I set it down again, after having examined it, my"
2852	"      heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper"
2852	"      with writing upon it. I raised it, and this was what I read,"
2852	"      roughly scrawled in pencil: “Dr. Watson has gone to Coombe"
2852	"      Tracey.”"
2852	""
2852	"      For a minute I stood there with the paper in my hands thinking"
2852	"      out the meaning of this curt message. It was I, then, and not Sir"
2852	"      Henry, who was being dogged by this secret man. He had not"
2852	"      followed me himself, but he had set an agent—the boy,"
2852	"      perhaps—upon my track, and this was his report. Possibly I had"
2852	"      taken no step since I had been upon the moor which had not been"
2852	"      observed and reported. Always there was this feeling of an unseen"
2852	"      force, a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and"
2852	"      delicacy, holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme"
2852	"      moment that one realised that one was indeed entangled in its"
2852	"      meshes."
2852	""
2852	"      If there was one report there might be others, so I looked round"
2852	"      the hut in search of them. There was no trace, however, of"
2852	"      anything of the kind, nor could I discover any sign which might"
2852	"      indicate the character or intentions of the man who lived in this"
2852	"      singular place, save that he must be of Spartan habits and cared"
2852	"      little for the comforts of life. When I thought of the heavy"
2852	"      rains and looked at the gaping roof I understood how strong and"
2852	"      immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that"
2852	"      inhospitable abode. Was he our malignant enemy, or was he by"
2852	"      chance our guardian angel? I swore that I would not leave the hut"
2852	"      until I knew."
2852	""
2852	"      Outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with"
2852	"      scarlet and gold. Its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches"
2852	"      by the distant pools which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire. There"
2852	"      were the two towers of Baskerville Hall, and there a distant blur"
2852	"      of smoke which marked the village of Grimpen. Between the two,"
2852	"      behind the hill, was the house of the Stapletons. All was sweet"
2852	"      and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light, and yet as I"
2852	"      looked at them my soul shared none of the peace of Nature but"
2852	"      quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which"
2852	"      every instant was bringing nearer. With tingling nerves but a"
2852	"      fixed purpose, I sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited"
2852	"      with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant."
2852	""
2852	"      And then at last I heard him. Far away came the sharp clink of a"
2852	"      boot striking upon a stone. Then another and yet another, coming"
2852	"      nearer and nearer. I shrank back into the darkest corner and"
2852	"      cocked the pistol in my pocket, determined not to discover myself"
2852	"      until I had an opportunity of seeing something of the stranger."
2852	"      There was a long pause which showed that he had stopped. Then"
2852	"      once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the"
2852	"      opening of the hut."
2852	""
2852	"      “It is a lovely evening, my dear Watson,” said a well-known"
2852	"      voice. “I really think that you will be more comfortable outside"
2852	"      than in.”"

2852	""
2852	"      For a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able to believe my"

2852	"      crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be"

2852	"      outside, his grey eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon"
2852	"      my astonished features. He was thin and worn, but clear and"
2852	"      alert, his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the"
2852	"      wind. In his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any other"
2852	"      tourist upon the moor, and he had contrived, with that catlike"
2852	"      love of personal cleanliness which was one of his"
2852	"      characteristics, that his chin should be as smooth and his linen"
2852	"      as perfect as if he were in Baker Street."
2852	""
2852	"      “I never was more glad to see anyone in my life,” said I as I"

2852	"      “Well, I must confess to it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “The surprise was not all on one side, I assure you. I had no"

2852	""
2852	"      “No, Watson, I fear that I could not undertake to recognize your"
2852	"      footprint amid all the footprints of the world. If you seriously"
2852	"      desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist; for when I"
2852	"      see the stub of a cigarette marked Bradley, Oxford Street, I know"
2852	"      that my friend Watson is in the neighbourhood. You will see it"
2852	"      there beside the path. You threw it down, no doubt, at that"

2852	""
2852	"      “Exactly.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I thought as much—and knowing your admirable tenacity I was"
2852	"      convinced that you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach,"
2852	"      waiting for the tenant to return. So you actually thought that I"

2852	"      “I did not know who you were, but I was determined to find out.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Excellent, Watson! And how did you localise me? You saw me,"
2852	"      perhaps, on the night of the convict hunt, when I was so"
2852	"      imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, I saw you then.”"

2852	""

2852	""
2852	"      “Well done! Our researches have evidently been running on"

2852	"      have a fairly full knowledge of the case.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, I am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed the"
2852	"      responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my"
2852	"      nerves. But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what"
2852	"      have you been doing? I thought that you were in Baker Street"
2852	"      working out that case of blackmailing.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That was what I wished you to think.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!” I cried with some"

2852	""
2852	"      “My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in"
2852	"      many other cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have"
2852	"      seemed to play a trick upon you. In truth, it was partly for your"
2852	"      own sake that I did it, and it was my appreciation of the danger"
2852	"      which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter"
2852	"      for myself. Had I been with Sir Henry and you it is confident"
2852	"      that my point of view would have been the same as yours, and my"
2852	"      presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on"
2852	"      their guard. As it is, I have been able to get about as I could"
2852	"      not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall, and I"
2852	"      remain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in all"
2852	"      my weight at a critical moment.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But why keep me in the dark?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “For you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have"
2852	"      led to my discovery. You would have wished to tell me something,"
2852	"      or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or"
2852	"      other, and so an unnecessary risk would be run. I brought"
2852	"      Cartwright down with me—you remember the little chap at the"
2852	"      express office—and he has seen after my simple wants: a loaf of"
2852	"      bread and a clean collar. What does man want more? He has given"
2852	"      me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of feet, and"
2852	"      both have been invaluable.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Then my reports have all been wasted!”—My voice trembled as I"
2852	"      recalled the pains and the pride with which I had composed them."
2852	""
2852	"      Holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket."
2852	""
2852	"      “Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I"
2852	"      assure you. I made excellent arrangements, and they are only"
2852	"      delayed one day upon their way. I must compliment you exceedingly"
2852	"      upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an"
2852	"      extraordinarily difficult case.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I was still rather raw over the deception which had been"
2852	"      practised upon me, but the warmth of Holmes’s praise drove my"
2852	"      anger from my mind. I felt also in my heart that he was right in"
2852	"      what he said and that it was really best for our purpose that I"
2852	"      should not have known that he was upon the moor."
2852	""
2852	"      “That’s better,” said he, seeing the shadow rise from my face."
2852	"      “And now tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Laura Lyons—it"
2852	"      was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you"
2852	"      had gone, for I am already aware that she is the one person in"
2852	"      Coombe Tracey who might be of service to us in the matter. In"
2852	"      fact, if you had not gone today it is exceedingly probable that I"
2852	"      should have gone tomorrow.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. The air had"
2852	"      turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. There,"
2852	"      sitting together in the twilight, I told Holmes of my"
2852	"      conversation with the lady. So interested was he that I had to"
2852	"      repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied."
2852	""
2852	"      “This is most important,” said he when I had concluded. “It fills"
2852	"      up a gap which I had been unable to bridge in this most complex"
2852	"      affair. You are aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists"
2852	"      between this lady and the man Stapleton?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I did not know of a close intimacy.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “There can be no doubt about the matter. They meet, they write,"
2852	"      there is a complete understanding between them. Now, this puts a"
2852	"      very powerful weapon into our hands. If I could only use it to"
2852	"      detach his wife—”"
2852	""
2852	"      “His wife?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I am giving you some information now, in return for all that you"
2852	"      have given me. The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton is"
2852	"      in reality his wife.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Good heavens, Holmes! Are you sure of what you say? How could he"
2852	"      have permitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Sir Henry’s falling in love could do no harm to anyone except"
2852	"      Sir Henry. He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make"
2852	"      love to her, as you have yourself observed. I repeat that the"
2852	"      lady is his wife and not his sister.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But why this elaborate deception?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to"
2852	"      him in the character of a free woman.”"
2852	""
2852	"      All my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly took"
2852	"      shape and centred upon the naturalist. In that impassive"
2852	"      colourless man, with his straw hat and his butterfly-net, I"
2852	"      seemed to see something terrible—a creature of infinite patience"
2852	"      and craft, with a smiling face and a murderous heart."
2852	""
2852	"      “It is he, then, who is our enemy—it is he who dogged us in"
2852	"      London?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “So I read the riddle.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And the warning—it must have come from her!”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Exactly.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The shape of some monstrous villainy, half seen, half guessed,"
2852	"      loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long."
2852	""
2852	"      “But are you sure of this, Holmes? How do you know that the woman"
2852	"      is his wife?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of"
2852	"      autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you, and I dare"
2852	"      say he has many a time regretted it since. He was once a"
2852	"      schoolmaster in the north of England. Now, there is no one more"
2852	"      easy to trace than a schoolmaster. There are scholastic agencies"
2852	"      by which one may identify any man who has been in the profession."
2852	"      A little investigation showed me that a school had come to grief"
2852	"      under atrocious circumstances, and that the man who had owned"
2852	"      it—the name was different—had disappeared with his wife. The"
2852	"      descriptions agreed. When I learned that the missing man was"
2852	"      devoted to entomology the identification was complete.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the"
2852	"      shadows."
2852	""
2852	"      “If this woman is in truth his wife, where does Mrs. Laura Lyons"
2852	"      come in?” I asked."
2852	""
2852	"      “That is one of the points upon which your own researches have"
2852	"      shed a light. Your interview with the lady has cleared the"
2852	"      situation very much. I did not know about a projected divorce"
2852	"      between herself and her husband. In that case, regarding"
2852	"      Stapleton as an unmarried man, she counted no doubt upon becoming"
2852	"      his wife.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And when she is undeceived?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Why, then we may find the lady of service. It must be our first"
2852	"      duty to see her—both of us—tomorrow. Don’t you think, Watson,"
2852	"      that you are away from your charge rather long? Your place should"
2852	"      be at Baskerville Hall.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had"
2852	"      settled upon the moor. A few faint stars were gleaming in a"
2852	"      violet sky."
2852	""
2852	"      “One last question, Holmes,” I said as I rose. “Surely there is"
2852	"      no need of secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning of it"
2852	"      all? What is he after?”"
2852	""
2852	"      Holmes’s voice sank as he answered:"
2852	""
2852	"      “It is murder, Watson—refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder."
2852	"      Do not ask me for particulars. My nets are closing upon him, even"
2852	"      as his are upon Sir Henry, and with your help he is already"
2852	"      almost at my mercy. There is but one danger which can threaten"
2852	"      us. It is that he should strike before we are ready to do so."
2852	"      Another day—two at the most—and I have my case complete, but"
2852	"      until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother"
2852	"      watched her ailing child. Your mission today has justified"
2852	"      itself, and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his"
2852	"      side. Hark!”"
2852	""
2852	"      A terrible scream—a prolonged yell of horror and anguish—burst"
2852	"      out of the silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned the"
2852	"      blood to ice in my veins."
2852	""
2852	"      “Oh, my God!” I gasped. “What is it? What does it mean?”"
2852	""
2852	"      Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic"
2852	"      outline at the door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head"
2852	"      thrust forward, his face peering into the darkness."
2852	""
2852	"      “Hush!” he whispered. “Hush!”"
2852	""
2852	"      The cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had"
2852	"      pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it"
2852	"      burst upon our ears, nearer, louder, more urgent than before."
2852	""
2852	"      “Where is it?” Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of"
2852	"      his voice that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul."
2852	"      “Where is it, Watson?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “There, I think.” I pointed into the darkness."
2852	""
2852	"      “No, there!”"
2852	""
2852	"      Again the agonised cry swept through the silent night, louder and"
2852	"      much nearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a deep,"
2852	"      muttered rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling"
2852	"      like the low, constant murmur of the sea."
2852	""
2852	"      “The hound!” cried Holmes. “Come, Watson, come! Great heavens, if"
2852	"      we are too late!”"
2852	""
2852	"      He had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed"
2852	"      at his heels. But now from somewhere among the broken ground"
2852	"      immediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell,"
2852	"      and then a dull, heavy thud. We halted and listened. Not another"
2852	"      sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night."
2852	""
2852	"      I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted."
2852	"      He stamped his feet upon the ground."
2852	""
2852	"      “He has beaten us, Watson. We are too late.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, no, surely not!”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Fool that I was to hold my hand. And you, Watson, see what comes"
2852	"      of abandoning your charge! But, by Heaven, if the worst has"
2852	"      happened we’ll avenge him!”"
2852	""
2852	"      Blindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders,"
2852	"      forcing our way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and"
2852	"      rushing down slopes, heading always in the direction whence those"
2852	"      dreadful sounds had come. At every rise Holmes looked eagerly"
2852	"      round him, but the shadows were thick upon the moor, and nothing"
2852	"      moved upon its dreary face."
2852	""
2852	"      “Can you see anything?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Nothing.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But, hark, what is that?”"
2852	""
2852	"      A low moan had fallen upon our ears. There it was again upon our"
2852	"      left! On that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which"
2852	"      overlooked a stone-strewn slope. On its jagged face was"
2852	"      spread-eagled some dark, irregular object. As we ran towards it"
2852	"      the vague outline hardened into a definite shape. It was a"
2852	"      prostrate man face downward upon the ground, the head doubled"
2852	"      under him at a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded and the body"
2852	"      hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault. So"
2852	"      grotesque was the attitude that I could not for the instant"
2852	"      realise that that moan had been the passing of his soul. Not a"
2852	"      whisper, not a rustle, rose now from the dark figure over which"
2852	"      we stooped. Holmes laid his hand upon him and held it up again"
2852	"      with an exclamation of horror. The gleam of the match which he"
2852	"      struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool"
2852	"      which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim. And it"
2852	"      shone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faint"
2852	"      within us—the body of Sir Henry Baskerville!"
2852	""
2852	"      There was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar"
2852	"      ruddy tweed suit—the very one which he had worn on the first"
2852	"      morning that we had seen him in Baker Street. We caught the one"
2852	"      clear glimpse of it, and then the match flickered and went out,"
2852	"      even as the hope had gone out of our souls. Holmes groaned, and"
2852	"      his face glimmered white through the darkness."
2852	""
2852	"      “The brute! The brute!” I cried with clenched hands. “Oh Holmes,"
2852	"      I shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I am more to blame than you, Watson. In order to have my case"
2852	"      well rounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of my"
2852	"      client. It is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my"
2852	"      career. But how could I know—how _could_ I know—that he would"
2852	"      risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my"
2852	"      warnings?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That we should have heard his screams—my God, those screams!—and"
2852	"      yet have been unable to save him! Where is this brute of a hound"
2852	"      which drove him to his death? It may be lurking among these rocks"
2852	"      at this instant. And Stapleton, where is he? He shall answer for"
2852	"      this deed.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He shall. I will see to that. Uncle and nephew have been"
2852	"      murdered—the one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast"
2852	"      which he thought to be supernatural, the other driven to his end"
2852	"      in his wild flight to escape from it. But now we have to prove"
2852	"      the connection between the man and the beast. Save from what we"
2852	"      heard, we cannot even swear to the existence of the latter, since"
2852	"      Sir Henry has evidently died from the fall. But, by heavens,"
2852	"      cunning as he is, the fellow shall be in my power before another"
2852	"      day is past!”"
2852	""
2852	"      We stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body,"
2852	"      overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had"
2852	"      brought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end. Then"
2852	"      as the moon rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which"
2852	"      our poor friend had fallen, and from the summit we gazed out over"
2852	"      the shadowy moor, half silver and half gloom. Far away, miles"
2852	"      off, in the direction of Grimpen, a single steady yellow light"
2852	"      was shining. It could only come from the lonely abode of the"
2852	"      Stapletons. With a bitter curse I shook my fist at it as I gazed."
2852	""
2852	"      “Why should we not seize him at once?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Our case is not complete. The fellow is wary and cunning to the"
2852	"      last degree. It is not what we know, but what we can prove. If we"
2852	"      make one false move the villain may escape us yet.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “What can we do?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “There will be plenty for us to do tomorrow. Tonight we can only"
2852	"      perform the last offices to our poor friend.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Together we made our way down the precipitous slope and"
2852	"      approached the body, black and clear against the silvered stones."
2852	"      The agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain"
2852	"      and blurred my eyes with tears."
2852	""
2852	"      “We must send for help, Holmes! We cannot carry him all the way"
2852	"      to the Hall. Good heavens, are you mad?”"
2852	""
2852	"      He had uttered a cry and bent over the body. Now he was dancing"
2852	"      and laughing and wringing my hand. Could this be my stern,"
2852	"      self-contained friend? These were hidden fires, indeed!"
2852	""
2852	"      “A beard! A beard! The man has a beard!”"
2852	""
2852	"      “A beard?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It is not the baronet—it is—why, it is my neighbour, the"
2852	"      convict!”"
2852	""
2852	"      With feverish haste we had turned the body over, and that"
2852	"      dripping beard was pointing up to the cold, clear moon. There"
2852	"      could be no doubt about the beetling forehead, the sunken animal"
2852	"      eyes. It was indeed the same face which had glared upon me in the"
2852	"      light of the candle from over the rock—the face of Selden, the"
2852	"      criminal."
2852	""
2852	"      Then in an instant it was all clear to me. I remembered how the"
2852	"      baronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to"
2852	"      Barrymore. Barrymore had passed it on in order to help Selden in"
2852	"      his escape. Boots, shirt, cap—it was all Sir Henry’s. The tragedy"
2852	"      was still black enough, but this man had at least deserved death"
2852	"      by the laws of his country. I told Holmes how the matter stood,"
2852	"      my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy."
2852	""
2852	"      “Then the clothes have been the poor devil’s death,” said he. “It"
2852	"      is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article"
2852	"      of Sir Henry’s—the boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in all"
2852	"      probability—and so ran this man down. There is one very singular"
2852	"      thing, however: How came Selden, in the darkness, to know that"
2852	"      the hound was on his trail?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He heard him.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “To hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like"
2852	"      this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk"
2852	"      recapture by screaming wildly for help. By his cries he must have"
2852	"      run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track. How did"
2852	"      he know?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “A greater mystery to me is why this hound, presuming that all"
2852	"      our conjectures are correct—”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I presume nothing.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, then, why this hound should be loose tonight. I suppose"
2852	"      that it does not always run loose upon the moor. Stapleton would"
2852	"      not let it go unless he had reason to think that Sir Henry would"
2852	"      be there.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “My difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I think"
2852	"      that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while"
2852	"      mine may remain forever a mystery. The question now is, what"
2852	"      shall we do with this poor wretch’s body? We cannot leave it here"
2852	"      to the foxes and the ravens.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can"
2852	"      communicate with the police.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Exactly. I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far."
2852	"      Halloa, Watson, what’s this? It’s the man himself, by all that’s"
2852	"      wonderful and audacious! Not a word to show your suspicions—not a"
2852	"      word, or my plans crumble to the ground.”"
2852	""
2852	"      A figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red"
2852	"      glow of a cigar. The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish"
2852	"      the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist. He stopped"
2852	"      when he saw us, and then came on again."
2852	""
2852	"      “Why, Dr. Watson, that’s not you, is it? You are the last man"
2852	"      that I should have expected to see out on the moor at this time"
2852	"      of night. But, dear me, what’s this? Somebody hurt? Not—don’t"
2852	"      tell me that it is our friend Sir Henry!” He hurried past me and"
2852	"      stooped over the dead man. I heard a sharp intake of his breath"
2852	"      and the cigar fell from his fingers."
2852	""
2852	"      “Who—who’s this?” he stammered."
2852	""
2852	"      “It is Selden, the man who escaped from Princetown.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme effort"
2852	"      he had overcome his amazement and his disappointment. He looked"
2852	"      sharply from Holmes to me. “Dear me! What a very shocking affair!"
2852	"      How did he die?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks."
2852	"      My friend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I heard a cry also. That was what brought me out. I was uneasy"
2852	"      about Sir Henry.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Why about Sir Henry in particular?” I could not help asking."
2852	""
2852	"      “Because I had suggested that he should come over. When he did"
2852	"      not come I was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his"
2852	"      safety when I heard cries upon the moor. By the way”—his eyes"
2852	"      darted again from my face to Holmes’s—“did you hear anything else"
2852	"      besides a cry?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No,” said Holmes; “did you?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “What do you mean, then?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Oh, you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom"
2852	"      hound, and so on. It is said to be heard at night upon the moor."
2852	"      I was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound"
2852	"      tonight.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “We heard nothing of the kind,” said I."
2852	""
2852	"      “And what is your theory of this poor fellow’s death?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off"
2852	"      his head. He has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and"
2852	"      eventually fallen over here and broken his neck.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That seems the most reasonable theory,” said Stapleton, and he"
2852	"      gave a sigh which I took to indicate his relief. “What do you"
2852	"      think about it, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”"
2852	""
2852	"      My friend bowed his compliments. “You are quick at"
2852	"      identification,” said he."
2852	""
2852	"      “We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson came"
2852	"      down. You are in time to see a tragedy.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend’s explanation will"
2852	"      cover the facts. I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to"
2852	"      London with me tomorrow.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Oh, you return tomorrow?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That is my intention.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences"
2852	"      which have puzzled us?”"
2852	""
2852	"      Holmes shrugged his shoulders."
2852	""
2852	"      “One cannot always have the success for which one hopes. An"
2852	"      investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours. It has not"
2852	"      been a satisfactory case.”"
2852	""
2852	"      My friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner."
2852	"      Stapleton still looked hard at him. Then he turned to me."
2852	""
2852	"      “I would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but it"
2852	"      would give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified"
2852	"      in doing it. I think that if we put something over his face he"
2852	"      will be safe until morning.”"
2852	""
2852	"      And so it was arranged. Resisting Stapleton’s offer of"
2852	"      hospitality, Holmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving"
2852	"      the naturalist to return alone. Looking back we saw the figure"
2852	"      moving slowly away over the broad moor, and behind him that one"
2852	"      black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was"
2852	"      lying who had come so horribly to his end."
2852	""
2852	"      “We’re at close grips at last,” said Holmes as we walked together"
2852	"      across the moor. “What a nerve the fellow has! How he pulled"
2852	"      himself together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing"
2852	"      shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his"
2852	"      plot. I told you in London, Watson, and I tell you now again,"
2852	"      that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I am sorry that he has seen you.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And so was I at first. But there was no getting out of it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he"
2852	"      knows you are here?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him to"
2852	"      desperate measures at once. Like most clever criminals, he may be"
2852	"      too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has"
2852	"      completely deceived us.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Why should we not arrest him at once?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “My dear Watson, you were born to be a man of action. Your"
2852	"      instinct is always to do something energetic. But supposing, for"
2852	"      argument’s sake, that we had him arrested tonight, what on earth"
2852	"      the better off should we be for that? We could prove nothing"
2852	"      against him. There’s the devilish cunning of it! If he were"
2852	"      acting through a human agent we could get some evidence, but if"
2852	"      we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not"
2852	"      help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Surely we have a case.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Not a shadow of one—only surmise and conjecture. We should be"
2852	"      laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such"
2852	"      evidence.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “There is Sir Charles’s death.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Found dead without a mark upon him. You and I know that he died"
2852	"      of sheer fright, and we know also what frightened him, but how"
2852	"      are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it? What signs are"
2852	"      there of a hound? Where are the marks of its fangs? Of course we"
2852	"      know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that Sir Charles"
2852	"      was dead before ever the brute overtook him. But we have to prove"
2852	"      all this, and we are not in a position to do it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, then, tonight?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “We are not much better off tonight. Again, there was no direct"
2852	"      connection between the hound and the man’s death. We never saw"
2852	"      the hound. We heard it, but we could not prove that it was"
2852	"      running upon this man’s trail. There is a complete absence of"
2852	"      motive. No, my dear fellow; we must reconcile ourselves to the"
2852	"      fact that we have no case at present, and that it is worth our"
2852	"      while to run any risk in order to establish one.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And how do you propose to do so?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us when"
2852	"      the position of affairs is made clear to her. And I have my own"
2852	"      plan as well. Sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof; but I"
2852	"      hope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost in"
2852	"      thought, as far as the Baskerville gates."
2852	""
2852	"      “Are you coming up?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes; I see no reason for further concealment. But one last word,"
2852	"      Watson. Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry. Let him think that"
2852	"      Selden’s death was as Stapleton would have us believe. He will"
2852	"      have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo"
2852	"      tomorrow, when he is engaged, if I remember your report aright,"
2852	"      to dine with these people.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And so am I.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone. That will be"
2852	"      easily arranged. And now, if we are too late for dinner, I think"
2852	"      that we are both ready for our suppers.”"

2852	"Fixing the Nets"
2852	""
2852	""
2852	"      Sir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock Holmes,"
2852	"      for he had for some days been expecting that recent events would"
2852	"      bring him down from London. He did raise his eyebrows, however,"
2852	"      when he found that my friend had neither any luggage nor any"
2852	"      explanations for its absence. Between us we soon supplied his"
2852	"      wants, and then over a belated supper we explained to the baronet"
2852	"      as much of our experience as it seemed desirable that he should"
2852	"      know. But first I had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news to"
2852	"      Barrymore and his wife. To him it may have been an unmitigated"
2852	"      relief, but she wept bitterly in her apron. To all the world he"
2852	"      was the man of violence, half animal and half demon; but to her"
2852	"      he always remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood, the"
2852	"      child who had clung to her hand. Evil indeed is the man who has"
2852	"      not one woman to mourn him."
2852	""
2852	"      “I’ve been moping in the house all day since Watson went off in"
2852	"      the morning,” said the baronet. “I guess I should have some"
2852	"      credit, for I have kept my promise. If I hadn’t sworn not to go"
2852	"      about alone I might have had a more lively evening, for I had a"
2852	"      message from Stapleton asking me over there.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening,”"
2852	"      said Holmes drily. “By the way, I don’t suppose you appreciate"
2852	"      that we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck?”"
2852	""
2852	"      Sir Henry opened his eyes. “How was that?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “This poor wretch was dressed in your clothes. I fear your"
2852	"      servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the"
2852	"      police.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That is unlikely. There was no mark on any of them, as far as I"
2852	"      know.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That’s lucky for him—in fact, it’s lucky for all of you, since"
2852	"      you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter. I am not"
2852	"      sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to"
2852	"      arrest the whole household. Watson’s reports are most"
2852	"      incriminating documents.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But how about the case?” asked the baronet. “Have you made"
2852	"      anything out of the tangle? I don’t know that Watson and I are"
2852	"      much the wiser since we came down.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I think that I shall be in a position to make the situation"
2852	"      rather more clear to you before long. It has been an exceedingly"
2852	"      difficult and most complicated business. There are several points"
2852	"      upon which we still want light—but it is coming all the same.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “We’ve had one experience, as Watson has no doubt told you. We"
2852	"      heard the hound on the moor, so I can swear that it is not all"
2852	"      empty superstition. I had something to do with dogs when I was"
2852	"      out West, and I know one when I hear one. If you can muzzle that"
2852	"      one and put him on a chain I’ll be ready to swear you are the"
2852	"      greatest detective of all time.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I think I will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will"
2852	"      give me your help.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Whatever you tell me to do I will do.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Very good; and I will ask you also to do it blindly, without"
2852	"      always asking the reason.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Just as you like.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “If you will do this I think the chances are that our little"
2852	"      problem will soon be solved. I have no doubt—”"
2852	""
2852	"      He stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the"
2852	"      air. The lamp beat upon his face, and so intent was it and so"
2852	"      still that it might have been that of a clear-cut classical"
2852	"      statue, a personification of alertness and expectation."
2852	""
2852	"      “What is it?” we both cried."
2852	""
2852	"      I could see as he looked down that he was repressing some"
2852	"      internal emotion. His features were still composed, but his eyes"
2852	"      shone with amused exultation."
2852	""
2852	"      “Excuse the admiration of a connoisseur,” said he as he waved his"
2852	"      hand towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite"
2852	"      wall. “Watson won’t allow that I know anything of art but that is"
2852	"      mere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ. Now,"
2852	"      these are a really very fine series of portraits.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Well, I’m glad to hear you say so,” said Sir Henry, glancing"
2852	"      with some surprise at my friend. “I don’t pretend to know much"
2852	"      about these things, and I’d be a better judge of a horse or a"
2852	"      steer than of a picture. I didn’t know that you found time for"
2852	"      such things.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I know what is good when I see it, and I see it now. That’s a"
2852	"      Kneller, I’ll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, and"
2852	"      the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds. They are"
2852	"      all family portraits, I presume?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Every one.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Do you know the names?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Barrymore has been coaching me in them, and I think I can say my"
2852	"      lessons fairly well.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Who is the gentleman with the telescope?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney in the"
2852	"      West Indies. The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is"
2852	"      Sir William Baskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of the"
2852	"      House of Commons under Pitt.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And this Cavalier opposite to me—the one with the black velvet"
2852	"      and the lace?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Ah, you have a right to know about him. That is the cause of all"
2852	"      the mischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound of the"
2852	"      Baskervilles. We’re not likely to forget him.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait."
2852	""
2852	"      “Dear me!” said Holmes, “he seems a quiet, meek-mannered man"
2852	"      enough, but I dare say that there was a lurking devil in his"
2852	"      eyes. I had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “There’s no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the"
2852	"      date, 1647, are on the back of the canvas.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Holmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer"
2852	"      seemed to have a fascination for him, and his eyes were"
2852	"      continually fixed upon it during supper. It was not until later,"
2852	"      when Sir Henry had gone to his room, that I was able to follow"
2852	"      the trend of his thoughts. He led me back into the"
2852	"      banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle in his hand, and he held it"
2852	"      up against the time-stained portrait on the wall."
2852	""
2852	"      “Do you see anything there?”"
2852	""
2852	"      I looked at the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, the"
2852	"      white lace collar, and the straight, severe face which was framed"
2852	"      between them. It was not a brutal countenance, but it was prim,"
2852	"      hard, and stern, with a firm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly"
2852	"      intolerant eye."
2852	""
2852	"      “Is it like anyone you know?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “There is something of Sir Henry about the jaw.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Just a suggestion, perhaps. But wait an instant!” He stood upon"
2852	"      a chair, and, holding up the light in his left hand, he curved"
2852	"      his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets."
2852	""
2852	"      “Good heavens!” I cried in amazement."
2852	""
2852	"      The face of Stapleton had sprung out of the canvas."
2852	""
2852	"      “Ha, you see it now. My eyes have been trained to examine faces"
2852	"      and not their trimmings. It is the first quality of a criminal"
2852	"      investigator that he should see through a disguise.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But this is marvellous. It might be his portrait.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, it is an interesting instance of a throwback, which appears"
2852	"      to be both physical and spiritual. A study of family portraits is"
2852	"      enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation. The"
2852	"      fellow is a Baskerville—that is evident.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “With designs upon the succession.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Exactly. This chance of the picture has supplied us with one of"
2852	"      our most obvious missing links. We have him, Watson, we have him,"
2852	"      and I dare swear that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering"
2852	"      in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies. A pin, a"
2852	"      cork, and a card, and we add him to the Baker Street collection!”"
2852	"      He burst into one of his rare fits of laughter as he turned away"
2852	"      from the picture. I have not heard him laugh often, and it has"
2852	"      always boded ill to somebody."
2852	""
2852	"      I was up betimes in the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlier"
2852	"      still, for I saw him as I dressed, coming up the drive."
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, we should have a full day today,” he remarked, and he"
2852	"      rubbed his hands with the joy of action. “The nets are all in"
2852	"      place, and the drag is about to begin. We’ll know before the day"
2852	"      is out whether we have caught our big, lean-jawed pike, or"
2852	"      whether he has got through the meshes.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Have you been on the moor already?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I have sent a report from Grimpen to Princetown as to the death"
2852	"      of Selden. I think I can promise that none of you will be"
2852	"      troubled in the matter. And I have also communicated with my"
2852	"      faithful Cartwright, who would certainly have pined away at the"
2852	"      door of my hut, as a dog does at his master’s grave, if I had not"
2852	"      set his mind at rest about my safety.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “What is the next move?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “To see Sir Henry. Ah, here he is!”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Good-morning, Holmes,” said the baronet. “You look like a"
2852	"      general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That is the exact situation. Watson was asking for orders.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And so do I.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Very good. You are engaged, as I understand, to dine with our"
2852	"      friends the Stapletons tonight.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I hope that you will come also. They are very hospitable people,"
2852	"      and I am sure that they would be very glad to see you.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I fear that Watson and I must go to London.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “To London?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, I think that we should be more useful there at the present"
2852	"      juncture.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The baronet’s face perceptibly lengthened."
2852	""
2852	"      “I hoped that you were going to see me through this business. The"
2852	"      Hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is"
2852	"      alone.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “My dear fellow, you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what"
2852	"      I tell you. You can tell your friends that we should have been"
2852	"      happy to have come with you, but that urgent business required us"
2852	"      to be in town. We hope very soon to return to Devonshire. Will"
2852	"      you remember to give them that message?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “If you insist upon it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “There is no alternative, I assure you.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I saw by the baronet’s clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by"
2852	"      what he regarded as our desertion."
2852	""
2852	"      “When do you desire to go?” he asked coldly."
2852	""
2852	"      “Immediately after breakfast. We will drive in to Coombe Tracey,"
2852	"      but Watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come"
2852	"      back to you. Watson, you will send a note to Stapleton to tell"
2852	"      him that you regret that you cannot come.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I have a good mind to go to London with you,” said the baronet."
2852	"      “Why should I stay here alone?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Because it is your post of duty. Because you gave me your word"
2852	"      that you would do as you were told, and I tell you to stay.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “All right, then, I’ll stay.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “One more direction! I wish you to drive to Merripit House. Send"
2852	"      back your trap, however, and let them know that you intend to"
2852	"      walk home.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “To walk across the moor?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “But that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me"
2852	"      not to do.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “This time you may do it with safety. If I had not every"
2852	"      confidence in your nerve and courage I would not suggest it, but"
2852	"      it is essential that you should do it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Then I will do it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And as you value your life do not go across the moor in any"
2852	"      direction save along the straight path which leads from Merripit"
2852	"      House to the Grimpen Road, and is your natural way home.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I will do just what you say.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Very good. I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast"
2852	"      as possible, so as to reach London in the afternoon.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I was much astounded by this programme, though I remembered that"
2852	"      Holmes had said to Stapleton on the night before that his visit"
2852	"      would terminate next day. It had not crossed my mind however,"
2852	"      that he would wish me to go with him, nor could I understand how"
2852	"      we could both be absent at a moment which he himself declared to"
2852	"      be critical. There was nothing for it, however, but implicit"
2852	"      obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rueful friend, and a couple"
2852	"      of hours afterwards we were at the station of Coombe Tracey and"
2852	"      had dispatched the trap upon its return journey. A small boy was"
2852	"      waiting upon the platform."
2852	""
2852	"      “Any orders, sir?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You will take this train to town, Cartwright. The moment you"
2852	"      arrive you will send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, in my name,"
2852	"      to say that if he finds the pocketbook which I have dropped he is"
2852	"      to send it by registered post to Baker Street.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, sir.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And ask at the station office if there is a message for me.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The boy returned with a telegram, which Holmes handed to me. It"
2852	"      ran:"
2852	""
2852	"      Wire received. Coming down with unsigned warrant. Arrive"
2852	"      five-forty. Lestrade."
2852	""
2852	"      “That is in answer to mine of this morning. He is the best of the"
2852	"      professionals, I think, and we may need his assistance. Now,"
2852	"      Watson, I think that we cannot employ our time better than by"
2852	"      calling upon your acquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons.”"
2852	""
2852	"      His plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. He would use"
2852	"      the baronet in order to convince the Stapletons that we were"
2852	"      really gone, while we should actually return at the instant when"
2852	"      we were likely to be needed. That telegram from London, if"
2852	"      mentioned by Sir Henry to the Stapletons, must remove the last"
2852	"      suspicions from their minds. Already I seemed to see our nets"
2852	"      drawing closer around that lean-jawed pike."
2852	""
2852	"      Mrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes opened"
2852	"      his interview with a frankness and directness which considerably"
2852	"      amazed her."
2852	""
2852	"      “I am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of"
2852	"      the late Sir Charles Baskerville,” said he. “My friend here, Dr."
2852	"      Watson, has informed me of what you have communicated, and also"
2852	"      of what you have withheld in connection with that matter.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “What have I withheld?” she asked defiantly."
2852	""
2852	"      “You have confessed that you asked Sir Charles to be at the gate"
2852	"      at ten o’clock. We know that that was the place and hour of his"
2852	"      death. You have withheld what the connection is between these"
2852	"      events.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “There is no connection.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “In that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary"
2852	"      one. But I think that we shall succeed in establishing a"
2852	"      connection, after all. I wish to be perfectly frank with you,"
2852	"      Mrs. Lyons. We regard this case as one of murder, and the"
2852	"      evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr. Stapleton but his"
2852	"      wife as well.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The lady sprang from her chair."
2852	""
2852	"      “His wife!” she cried."
2852	""
2852	"      “The fact is no longer a secret. The person who has passed for"
2852	"      his sister is really his wife.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Mrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her hands were grasping the arms"
2852	"      of her chair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white with"
2852	"      the pressure of her grip."
2852	""
2852	"      “His wife!” she said again. “His wife! He is not a married man.”"
2852	""
2852	"      Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders."
2852	""
2852	"      “Prove it to me! Prove it to me! And if you can do so—!”"
2852	""
2852	"      The fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words."
2852	""
2852	"      “I have come prepared to do so,” said Holmes, drawing several"
2852	"      papers from his pocket. “Here is a photograph of the couple taken"
2852	"      in York four years ago. It is indorsed ‘Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,’"
2852	"      but you will have no difficulty in recognizing him, and her also,"
2852	"      if you know her by sight. Here are three written descriptions by"
2852	"      trustworthy witnesses of Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur, who at that time"
2852	"      kept St. Oliver’s private school. Read them and see if you can"
2852	"      doubt the identity of these people.”"
2852	""
2852	"      She glanced at them, and then looked up at us with the set, rigid"
2852	"      face of a desperate woman."
2852	""
2852	"      “Mr. Holmes,” she said, “this man had offered me marriage on"
2852	"      condition that I could get a divorce from my husband. He has lied"
2852	"      to me, the villain, in every conceivable way. Not one word of"
2852	"      truth has he ever told me. And why—why? I imagined that all was"
2852	"      for my own sake. But now I see that I was never anything but a"
2852	"      tool in his hands. Why should I preserve faith with him who never"
2852	"      kept any with me? Why should I try to shield him from the"
2852	"      consequences of his own wicked acts? Ask me what you like, and"
2852	"      there is nothing which I shall hold back. One thing I swear to"
2852	"      you, and that is that when I wrote the letter I never dreamed of"
2852	"      any harm to the old gentleman, who had been my kindest friend.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I entirely believe you, madam,” said Sherlock Holmes. “The"
2852	"      recital of these events must be very painful to you, and perhaps"
2852	"      it will make it easier if I tell you what occurred, and you can"
2852	"      check me if I make any material mistake. The sending of this"
2852	"      letter was suggested to you by Stapleton?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He dictated it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive"
2852	"      help from Sir Charles for the legal expenses connected with your"
2852	"      divorce?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Exactly.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from"
2852	"      keeping the appointment?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He told me that it would hurt his self-respect that any other"
2852	"      man should find the money for such an object, and that though he"
2852	"      was a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to removing"
2852	"      the obstacles which divided us.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He appears to be a very consistent character. And then you heard"
2852	"      nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with"
2852	"      Sir Charles?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He did. He said that the death was a very mysterious one, and"
2852	"      that I should certainly be suspected if the facts came out. He"
2852	"      frightened me into remaining silent.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Quite so. But you had your suspicions?”"
2852	""
2852	"      She hesitated and looked down."
2852	""
2852	"      “I knew him,” she said. “But if he had kept faith with me I"
2852	"      should always have done so with him.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape,” said"
2852	"      Sherlock Holmes. “You have had him in your power and he knew it,"
2852	"      and yet you are alive. You have been walking for some months very"
2852	"      near to the edge of a precipice. We must wish you good-morning"
2852	"      now, Mrs. Lyons, and it is probable that you will very shortly"
2852	"      hear from us again.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty"
2852	"      thins away in front of us,” said Holmes as we stood waiting for"
2852	"      the arrival of the express from town. “I shall soon be in the"
2852	"      position of being able to put into a single connected narrative"
2852	"      one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times."
2852	"      Students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in"
2852	"      Godno, in Little Russia, in the year ’66, and of course there are"
2852	"      the Anderson murders in North Carolina, but this case possesses"
2852	"      some features which are entirely its own. Even now we have no"
2852	"      clear case against this very wily man. But I shall be very much"
2852	"      surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this"
2852	"      night.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The London express came roaring into the station, and a small,"
2852	"      wiry bulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class carriage. We"
2852	"      all three shook hands, and I saw at once from the reverential way"
2852	"      in which Lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a"
2852	"      good deal since the days when they had first worked together. I"
2852	"      could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner"
2852	"      used then to excite in the practical man."
2852	""
2852	"      “Anything good?” he asked."
2852	""
2852	"      “The biggest thing for years,” said Holmes. “We have two hours"
2852	"      before we need think of starting. I think we might employ it in"
2852	"      getting some dinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the London"
2852	"      fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure night"
2852	"      air of Dartmoor. Never been there? Ah, well, I don’t suppose you"
2852	"      will forget your first visit.”"

2852	"The Hound of the Baskervilles"
2852	""
2852	""
2852	"      One of Sherlock Holmes’s defects—if, indeed, one may call it a"
2852	"      defect—was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full"
2852	"      plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment."
2852	"      Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature, which"
2852	"      loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him. Partly"
2852	"      also from his professional caution, which urged him never to take"
2852	"      any chances. The result, however, was very trying for those who"
2852	"      were acting as his agents and assistants. I had often suffered"
2852	"      under it, but never more so than during that long drive in the"
2852	"      darkness. The great ordeal was in front of us; at last we were"
2852	"      about to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing,"
2852	"      and I could only surmise what his course of action would be. My"
2852	"      nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon"
2852	"      our faces and the dark, void spaces on either side of the narrow"
2852	"      road told me that we were back upon the moor once again. Every"
2852	"      stride of the horses and every turn of the wheels was taking us"
2852	"      nearer to our supreme adventure."
2852	""
2852	"      Our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of"
2852	"      the hired wagonette, so that we were forced to talk of trivial"
2852	"      matters when our nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation."
2852	"      It was a relief to me, after that unnatural restraint, when we at"
2852	"      last passed Frankland’s house and knew that we were drawing near"
2852	"      to the Hall and to the scene of action. We did not drive up to"
2852	"      the door but got down near the gate of the avenue. The wagonette"
2852	"      was paid off and ordered to return to Coombe Tracey forthwith,"
2852	"      while we started to walk to Merripit House."
2852	""
2852	"      “Are you armed, Lestrade?”"
2852	""
2852	"      The little detective smiled. “As long as I have my trousers I"
2852	"      have a hip-pocket, and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have"
2852	"      something in it.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Good! My friend and I are also ready for emergencies.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You’re mighty close about this affair, Mr. Holmes. What’s the"
2852	"      game now?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “A waiting game.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “My word, it does not seem a very cheerful place,” said the"
2852	"      detective with a shiver, glancing round him at the gloomy slopes"
2852	"      of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over the"
2852	"      Grimpen Mire. “I see the lights of a house ahead of us.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That is Merripit House and the end of our journey. I must"
2852	"      request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper.”"
2852	""
2852	"      We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the"
2852	"      house, but Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards"
2852	"      from it."
2852	""
2852	"      “This will do,” said he. “These rocks upon the right make an"
2852	"      admirable screen.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “We are to wait here?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get into this hollow,"
2852	"      Lestrade. You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson?"
2852	"      Can you tell the position of the rooms? What are those latticed"
2852	"      windows at this end?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I think they are the kitchen windows.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And the one beyond, which shines so brightly?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “That is certainly the dining-room.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “The blinds are up. You know the lie of the land best. Creep"
2852	"      forward quietly and see what they are doing—but for heaven’s sake"
2852	"      don’t let them know that they are watched!”"
2852	""
2852	"      I tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which"
2852	"      surrounded the stunted orchard. Creeping in its shadow I reached"
2852	"      a point whence I could look straight through the uncurtained"
2852	"      window."
2852	""
2852	"      There were only two men in the room, Sir Henry and Stapleton."
2852	"      They sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the"
2852	"      round table. Both of them were smoking cigars, and coffee and"
2852	"      wine were in front of them. Stapleton was talking with animation,"
2852	"      but the baronet looked pale and distrait. Perhaps the thought of"
2852	"      that lonely walk across the ill-omened moor was weighing heavily"
2852	"      upon his mind."
2852	""
2852	"      As I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room, while Sir"
2852	"      Henry filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair,"
2852	"      puffing at his cigar. I heard the creak of a door and the crisp"
2852	"      sound of boots upon gravel. The steps passed along the path on"
2852	"      the other side of the wall under which I crouched. Looking over,"
2852	"      I saw the naturalist pause at the door of an out-house in the"
2852	"      corner of the orchard. A key turned in a lock, and as he passed"
2852	"      in there was a curious scuffling noise from within. He was only a"
2852	"      minute or so inside, and then I heard the key turn once more and"
2852	"      he passed me and reentered the house. I saw him rejoin his guest,"
2852	"      and I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to"
2852	"      tell them what I had seen."
2852	""
2852	"      “You say, Watson, that the lady is not there?” Holmes asked when"
2852	"      I had finished my report."
2852	""
2852	"      “No.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any other"
2852	"      room except the kitchen?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I cannot think where she is.”"
2852	""
2852	"      I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense,"
2852	"      white fog. It was drifting slowly in our direction and banked"
2852	"      itself up like a wall on that side of us, low but thick and well"
2852	"      defined. The moon shone on it, and it looked like a great"
2852	"      shimmering ice-field, with the heads of the distant tors as rocks"
2852	"      borne upon its surface. Holmes’s face was turned towards it, and"
2852	"      he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift."
2852	""
2852	"      “It’s moving towards us, Watson.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Is that serious?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Very serious, indeed—the one thing upon earth which could have"
2852	"      disarranged my plans. He can’t be very long, now. It is already"
2852	"      ten o’clock. Our success and even his life may depend upon his"
2852	"      coming out before the fog is over the path.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The night was clear and fine above us. The stars shone cold and"
2852	"      bright, while a half-moon bathed the whole scene in a soft,"
2852	"      uncertain light. Before us lay the dark bulk of the house, its"
2852	"      serrated roof and bristling chimneys hard outlined against the"
2852	"      silver-spangled sky. Broad bars of golden light from the lower"
2852	"      windows stretched across the orchard and the moor. One of them"
2852	"      was suddenly shut off. The servants had left the kitchen. There"
2852	"      only remained the lamp in the dining-room where the two men, the"
2852	"      murderous host and the unconscious guest, still chatted over"
2852	"      their cigars."
2852	""
2852	"      Every minute that white woolly plain which covered one-half of"
2852	"      the moor was drifting closer and closer to the house. Already the"
2852	"      first thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of"
2852	"      the lighted window. The farther wall of the orchard was already"
2852	"      invisible, and the trees were standing out of a swirl of white"
2852	"      vapour. As we watched it the fog-wreaths came crawling round both"
2852	"      corners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank on"
2852	"      which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship"
2852	"      upon a shadowy sea. Holmes struck his hand passionately upon the"
2852	"      rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience."
2852	""
2852	"      “If he isn’t out in a quarter of an hour the path will be"
2852	"      covered. In half an hour we won’t be able to see our hands in"
2852	"      front of us.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Shall we move farther back upon higher ground?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes, I think it would be as well.”"
2852	""
2852	"      So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we"
2852	"      were half a mile from the house, and still that dense white sea,"
2852	"      with the moon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and"
2852	"      inexorably on."
2852	""
2852	"      “We are going too far,” said Holmes. “We dare not take the chance"
2852	"      of his being overtaken before he can reach us. At all costs we"
2852	"      must hold our ground where we are.” He dropped on his knees and"
2852	"      clapped his ear to the ground. “Thank God, I think that I hear"
2852	"      him coming.”"
2852	""
2852	"      A sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor. Crouching"
2852	"      among the stones we stared intently at the silver-tipped bank in"
2852	"      front of us. The steps grew louder, and through the fog, as"
2852	"      through a curtain, there stepped the man whom we were awaiting."
2852	"      He looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear,"
2852	"      starlit night. Then he came swiftly along the path, passed close"
2852	"      to where we lay, and went on up the long slope behind us. As he"
2852	"      walked he glanced continually over either shoulder, like a man"
2852	"      who is ill at ease."
2852	""
2852	"      “Hist!” cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp click of a cocking"
2852	"      pistol. “Look out! It’s coming!”"
2852	""
2852	"      There was a thin, crisp, continuous patter from somewhere in the"
2852	"      heart of that crawling bank. The cloud was within fifty yards of"
2852	"      where we lay, and we glared at it, all three, uncertain what"
2852	"      horror was about to break from the heart of it. I was at Holmes’s"
2852	"      elbow, and I glanced for an instant at his face. It was pale and"
2852	"      exultant, his eyes shining brightly in the moonlight. But"
2852	"      suddenly they started forward in a rigid, fixed stare, and his"
2852	"      lips parted in amazement. At the same instant Lestrade gave a"
2852	"      yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground. I"
2852	"      sprang to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my mind"
2852	"      paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from"
2852	"      the shadows of the fog. A hound it was, an enormous coal-black"
2852	"      hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen. Fire"
2852	"      burst from its open mouth, its eyes glowed with a smouldering"
2852	"      glare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in"
2852	"      flickering flame. Never in the delirious dream of a disordered"
2852	"      brain could anything more savage, more appalling, more hellish be"
2852	"      conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke upon us"
2852	"      out of the wall of fog."
2852	""
2852	"      With long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the"
2852	"      track, following hard upon the footsteps of our friend. So"
2852	"      paralyzed were we by the apparition that we allowed him to pass"
2852	"      before we had recovered our nerve. Then Holmes and I both fired"
2852	"      together, and the creature gave a hideous howl, which showed that"
2852	"      one at least had hit him. He did not pause, however, but bounded"
2852	"      onward. Far away on the path we saw Sir Henry looking back, his"
2852	"      face white in the moonlight, his hands raised in horror, glaring"
2852	"      helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him down. But"
2852	"      that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the"
2852	"      winds. If he was vulnerable he was mortal, and if we could wound"
2852	"      him we could kill him. Never have I seen a man run as Holmes ran"
2852	"      that night. I am reckoned fleet of foot, but he outpaced me as"
2852	"      much as I outpaced the little professional. In front of us as we"
2852	"      flew up the track we heard scream after scream from Sir Henry and"
2852	"      the deep roar of the hound. I was in time to see the beast spring"
2852	"      upon its victim, hurl him to the ground, and worry at his throat."
2852	"      But the next instant Holmes had emptied five barrels of his"
2852	"      revolver into the creature’s flank. With a last howl of agony and"
2852	"      a vicious snap in the air, it rolled upon its back, four feet"
2852	"      pawing furiously, and then fell limp upon its side. I stooped,"
2852	"      panting, and pressed my pistol to the dreadful, shimmering head,"
2852	"      but it was useless to press the trigger. The giant hound was"
2852	"      dead."
2852	""
2852	"      Sir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen. We tore away his"
2852	"      collar, and Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw"
2852	"      that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in"
2852	"      time. Already our friend’s eyelids shivered and he made a feeble"
2852	"      effort to move. Lestrade thrust his brandy-flask between the"
2852	"      baronet’s teeth, and two frightened eyes were looking up at us."
2852	""
2852	"      “My God!” he whispered. “What was it? What, in heaven’s name, was"
2852	"      it?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It’s dead, whatever it is,” said Holmes. “We’ve laid the family"
2852	"      ghost once and forever.”"
2852	""
2852	"      In mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was"
2852	"      lying stretched before us. It was not a pure bloodhound and it"
2852	"      was not a pure mastiff; but it appeared to be a combination of"
2852	"      the two—gaunt, savage, and as large as a small lioness. Even now"
2852	"      in the stillness of death, the huge jaws seemed to be dripping"
2852	"      with a bluish flame and the small, deep-set, cruel eyes were"
2852	"      ringed with fire. I placed my hand upon the glowing muzzle, and"
2852	"      as I held them up my own fingers smouldered and gleamed in the"
2852	"      darkness."
2852	""
2852	"      “Phosphorus,” I said."
2852	""
2852	"      “A cunning preparation of it,” said Holmes, sniffing at the dead"
2852	"      animal. “There is no smell which might have interfered with his"
2852	"      power of scent. We owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, for having"
2852	"      exposed you to this fright. I was prepared for a hound, but not"
2852	"      for such a creature as this. And the fog gave us little time to"
2852	"      receive him.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “You have saved my life.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Having first endangered it. Are you strong enough to stand?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Give me another mouthful of that brandy and I shall be ready for"
2852	"      anything. So! Now, if you will help me up. What do you propose to"
2852	"      do?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “To leave you here. You are not fit for further adventures"
2852	"      tonight. If you will wait, one or other of us will go back with"
2852	"      you to the Hall.”"
2852	""
2852	"      He tried to stagger to his feet; but he was still ghastly pale"
2852	"      and trembling in every limb. We helped him to a rock, where he"
2852	"      sat shivering with his face buried in his hands."
2852	""
2852	"      “We must leave you now,” said Holmes. “The rest of our work must"
2852	"      be done, and every moment is of importance. We have our case, and"
2852	"      now we only want our man."
2852	""
2852	"      “It’s a thousand to one against our finding him at the house,” he"
2852	"      continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path. “Those"
2852	"      shots must have told him that the game was up.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “We were some distance off, and this fog may have deadened them.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He followed the hound to call him off—of that you may be"
2852	"      certain. No, no, he’s gone by this time! But we’ll search the"
2852	"      house and make sure.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The front door was open, so we rushed in and hurried from room to"
2852	"      room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant, who met us"
2852	"      in the passage. There was no light save in the dining-room, but"
2852	"      Holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house"
2852	"      unexplored. No sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing."
2852	"      On the upper floor, however, one of the bedroom doors was locked."
2852	""
2852	"      “There’s someone in here,” cried Lestrade. “I can hear a"
2852	"      movement. Open this door!”"
2852	""
2852	"      A faint moaning and rustling came from within. Holmes struck the"
2852	"      door just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew"
2852	"      open. Pistol in hand, we all three rushed into the room."
2852	""
2852	"      But there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant"
2852	"      villain whom we expected to see. Instead we were faced by an"
2852	"      object so strange and so unexpected that we stood for a moment"
2852	"      staring at it in amazement."
2852	""
2852	"      The room had been fashioned into a small museum, and the walls"
2852	"      were lined by a number of glass-topped cases full of that"
2852	"      collection of butterflies and moths the formation of which had"
2852	"      been the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man. In the"
2852	"      centre of this room there was an upright beam, which had been"
2852	"      placed at some period as a support for the old worm-eaten baulk"
2852	"      of timber which spanned the roof. To this post a figure was tied,"
2852	"      so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been used to"
2852	"      secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it was"
2852	"      that of a man or a woman. One towel passed round the throat and"
2852	"      was secured at the back of the pillar. Another covered the lower"
2852	"      part of the face, and over it two dark eyes—eyes full of grief"
2852	"      and shame and a dreadful questioning—stared back at us. In a"
2852	"      minute we had torn off the gag, unswathed the bonds, and Mrs."
2852	"      Stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us. As her beautiful"
2852	"      head fell upon her chest I saw the clear red weal of a whiplash"
2852	"      across her neck."
2852	""
2852	"      “The brute!” cried Holmes. “Here, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle!"
2852	"      Put her in the chair! She has fainted from ill-usage and"
2852	"      exhaustion.”"
2852	""
2852	"      She opened her eyes again."
2852	""
2852	"      “Is he safe?” she asked. “Has he escaped?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He cannot escape us, madam.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No, no, I did not mean my husband. Sir Henry? Is he safe?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Yes.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “And the hound?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It is dead.”"
2852	""
2852	"      She gave a long sigh of satisfaction."
2852	""
2852	"      “Thank God! Thank God! Oh, this villain! See how he has treated"
2852	"      me!” She shot her arms out from her sleeves, and we saw with"
2852	"      horror that they were all mottled with bruises. “But this is"
2852	"      nothing—nothing! It is my mind and soul that he has tortured and"
2852	"      defiled. I could endure it all, ill-usage, solitude, a life of"
2852	"      deception, everything, as long as I could still cling to the hope"
2852	"      that I had his love, but now I know that in this also I have been"
2852	"      his dupe and his tool.” She broke into passionate sobbing as she"
2852	"      spoke."
2852	""
2852	"      “You bear him no good will, madam,” said Holmes. “Tell us then"
2852	"      where we shall find him. If you have ever aided him in evil, help"
2852	"      us now and so atone.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “There is but one place where he can have fled,” she answered."
2852	"      “There is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire."
2852	"      It was there that he kept his hound and there also he had made"
2852	"      preparations so that he might have a refuge. That is where he"
2852	"      would fly.”"
2852	""
2852	"      The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. Holmes held"
2852	"      the lamp towards it."
2852	""
2852	"      “See,” said he. “No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire"
2852	"      tonight.”"
2852	""
2852	"      She laughed and clapped her hands. Her eyes and teeth gleamed"
2852	"      with fierce merriment."
2852	""
2852	"      “He may find his way in, but never out,” she cried. “How can he"
2852	"      see the guiding wands tonight? We planted them together, he and"
2852	"      I, to mark the pathway through the mire. Oh, if I could only have"
2852	"      plucked them out today. Then indeed you would have had him at"
2852	"      your mercy!”"
2852	""
2852	"      It was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog"
2852	"      had lifted. Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the house"
2852	"      while Holmes and I went back with the baronet to Baskerville"
2852	"      Hall. The story of the Stapletons could no longer be withheld"
2852	"      from him, but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth"
2852	"      about the woman whom he had loved. But the shock of the night’s"
2852	"      adventures had shattered his nerves, and before morning he lay"
2852	"      delirious in a high fever under the care of Dr. Mortimer. The two"
2852	"      of them were destined to travel together round the world before"
2852	"      Sir Henry had become once more the hale, hearty man that he had"
2852	"      been before he became master of that ill-omened estate."
2852	""
2852	"      And now I come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular"
2852	"      narrative, in which I have tried to make the reader share those"
2852	"      dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long and"
2852	"      ended in so tragic a manner. On the morning after the death of"
2852	"      the hound the fog had lifted and we were guided by Mrs. Stapleton"
2852	"      to the point where they had found a pathway through the bog. It"
2852	"      helped us to realise the horror of this woman’s life when we saw"
2852	"      the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husband’s"
2852	"      track. We left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm,"
2852	"      peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog. From the"
2852	"      end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the"
2852	"      path zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those"
2852	"      green-scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to the"
2852	"      stranger. Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour"
2852	"      of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our faces, while a"
2852	"      false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark,"
2852	"      quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around"
2852	"      our feet. Its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked,"
2852	"      and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was"
2852	"      tugging us down into those obscene depths, so grim and purposeful"
2852	"      was the clutch in which it held us. Once only we saw a trace that"
2852	"      someone had passed that perilous way before us. From amid a tuft"
2852	"      of cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing"
2852	"      was projecting. Holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the"
2852	"      path to seize it, and had we not been there to drag him out he"
2852	"      could never have set his foot upon firm land again. He held an"
2852	"      old black boot in the air. “Meyers, Toronto,” was printed on the"
2852	"      leather inside."
2852	""
2852	"      “It is worth a mud bath,” said he. “It is our friend Sir Henry’s"
2852	"      missing boot.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Thrown there by Stapleton in his flight.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Exactly. He retained it in his hand after using it to set the"
2852	"      hound upon the track. He fled when he knew the game was up, still"
2852	"      clutching it. And he hurled it away at this point of his flight."
2852	"      We know at least that he came so far in safety.”"
2852	""
2852	"      But more than that we were never destined to know, though there"
2852	"      was much which we might surmise. There was no chance of finding"
2852	"      footsteps in the mire, for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon"
2852	"      them, but as we at last reached firmer ground beyond the morass"
2852	"      we all looked eagerly for them. But no slightest sign of them"
2852	"      ever met our eyes. If the earth told a true story, then Stapleton"
2852	"      never reached that island of refuge towards which he struggled"
2852	"      through the fog upon that last night. Somewhere in the heart of"
2852	"      the great Grimpen Mire, down in the foul slime of the huge morass"
2852	"      which had sucked him in, this cold and cruel-hearted man is"
2852	"      forever buried."
2852	""
2852	"      Many traces we found of him in the bog-girt island where he had"
2852	"      hid his savage ally. A huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled"
2852	"      with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine. Beside it"
2852	"      were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners, driven"
2852	"      away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp. In one"
2852	"      of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones"
2852	"      showed where the animal had been confined. A skeleton with a"
2852	"      tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the _débris_."
2852	""
2852	"      “A dog!” said Holmes. “By Jove, a curly-haired spaniel. Poor"
2852	"      Mortimer will never see his pet again. Well, I do not know that"
2852	"      this place contains any secret which we have not already"
2852	"      fathomed. He could hide his hound, but he could not hush its"
2852	"      voice, and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not"
2852	"      pleasant to hear. On an emergency he could keep the hound in the"
2852	"      out-house at Merripit, but it was always a risk, and it was only"
2852	"      on the supreme day, which he regarded as the end of all his"
2852	"      efforts, that he dared do it. This paste in the tin is no doubt"
2852	"      the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed. It was"
2852	"      suggested, of course, by the story of the family hell-hound, and"
2852	"      by the desire to frighten old Sir Charles to death. No wonder the"
2852	"      poor devil of a convict ran and screamed, even as our friend did,"
2852	"      and as we ourselves might have done, when he saw such a creature"
2852	"      bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track. It was"
2852	"      a cunning device, for, apart from the chance of driving your"
2852	"      victim to his death, what peasant would venture to inquire too"
2852	"      closely into such a creature should he get sight of it, as many"
2852	"      have done, upon the moor? I said it in London, Watson, and I say"
2852	"      it again now, that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more"
2852	"      dangerous man than he who is lying yonder”—he swept his long arm"
2852	"      towards the huge mottled expanse of green-splotched bog which"
2852	"      stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the"
2852	"      moor."

2852	"A Retrospection"
2852	""
2852	""
2852	"      It was the end of November, and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and"
2852	"      foggy night, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-room"
2852	"      in Baker Street. Since the tragic upshot of our visit to"
2852	"      Devonshire he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmost"
2852	"      importance, in the first of which he had exposed the atrocious"
2852	"      conduct of Colonel Upwood in connection with the famous card"
2852	"      scandal of the Nonpareil Club, while in the second he had"
2852	"      defended the unfortunate Mme. Montpensier from the charge of"
2852	"      murder which hung over her in connection with the death of her"
2852	"      step-daughter, Mlle. Carére, the young lady who, as it will be"
2852	"      remembered, was found six months later alive and married in New"
2852	"      York. My friend was in excellent spirits over the success which"
2852	"      had attended a succession of difficult and important cases, so"
2852	"      that I was able to induce him to discuss the details of the"
2852	"      Baskerville mystery. I had waited patiently for the opportunity"
2852	"      for I was aware that he would never permit cases to overlap, and"
2852	"      that his clear and logical mind would not be drawn from its"
2852	"      present work to dwell upon memories of the past. Sir Henry and"
2852	"      Dr. Mortimer were, however, in London, on their way to that long"
2852	"      voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his"
2852	"      shattered nerves. They had called upon us that very afternoon, so"
2852	"      that it was natural that the subject should come up for"
2852	"      discussion."
2852	""
2852	"      “The whole course of events,” said Holmes, “from the point of"
2852	"      view of the man who called himself Stapleton was simple and"
2852	"      direct, although to us, who had no means in the beginning of"
2852	"      knowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part of"
2852	"      the facts, it all appeared exceedingly complex. I have had the"
2852	"      advantage of two conversations with Mrs. Stapleton, and the case"
2852	"      has now been so entirely cleared up that I am not aware that"
2852	"      there is anything which has remained a secret to us. You will"
2852	"      find a few notes upon the matter under the heading B in my"
2852	"      indexed list of cases.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of"
2852	"      events from memory.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “Certainly, though I cannot guarantee that I carry all the facts"
2852	"      in my mind. Intense mental concentration has a curious way of"
2852	"      blotting out what has passed. The barrister who has his case at"
2852	"      his fingers’ ends and is able to argue with an expert upon his"
2852	"      own subject finds that a week or two of the courts will drive it"
2852	"      all out of his head once more. So each of my cases displaces the"
2852	"      last, and Mlle. Carére has blurred my recollection of Baskerville"
2852	"      Hall. Tomorrow some other little problem may be submitted to my"

2852	"      “My inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait"
2852	"      did not lie, and that this fellow was indeed a Baskerville. He"
2852	"      was a son of that Rodger Baskerville, the younger brother of Sir"
2852	"      Charles, who fled with a sinister reputation to South America,"
2852	"      where he was said to have died unmarried. He did, as a matter of"
2852	"      fact, marry, and had one child, this fellow, whose real name is"
2852	"      the same as his father’s. He married Beryl Garcia, one of the"
2852	"      beauties of Costa Rica, and, having purloined a considerable sum"
2852	"      of public money, he changed his name to Vandeleur and fled to"
2852	"      England, where he established a school in the east of Yorkshire."
2852	"      His reason for attempting this special line of business was that"
2852	"      he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon"
2852	"      the voyage home, and that he had used this man’s ability to make"
2852	"      the undertaking a success. Fraser, the tutor, died however, and"
2852	"      the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy."
2852	"      The Vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to"
2852	"      Stapleton, and he brought the remains of his fortune, his schemes"
2852	"      for the future, and his taste for entomology to the south of"
2852	"      England. I learned at the British Museum that he was a recognized"
2852	"      authority upon the subject, and that the name of Vandeleur has"
2852	"      been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had, in his"
2852	"      Yorkshire days, been the first to describe."
2852	""
2852	"      “We now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be"
2852	"      of such intense interest to us. The fellow had evidently made"
2852	"      inquiry and found that only two lives intervened between him and"
2852	"      a valuable estate. When he went to Devonshire his plans were, I"
2852	"      believe, exceedingly hazy, but that he meant mischief from the"
2852	"      first is evident from the way in which he took his wife with him"
2852	"      in the character of his sister. The idea of using her as a decoy"
2852	"      was clearly already in his mind, though he may not have been"
2852	"      certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged. He meant"
2852	"      in the end to have the estate, and he was ready to use any tool"
2852	"      or run any risk for that end. His first act was to establish"
2852	"      himself as near to his ancestral home as he could, and his second"
2852	"      was to cultivate a friendship with Sir Charles Baskerville and"
2852	"      with the neighbours."
2852	""
2852	"      “The baronet himself told him about the family hound, and so"
2852	"      prepared the way for his own death. Stapleton, as I will continue"
2852	"      to call him, knew that the old man’s heart was weak and that a"
2852	"      shock would kill him. So much he had learned from Dr. Mortimer."
2852	"      He had heard also that Sir Charles was superstitious and had"
2852	"      taken this grim legend very seriously. His ingenious mind"
2852	"      instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could be done to"
2852	"      death, and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the"
2852	"      guilt to the real murderer."
2852	""
2852	"      “Having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with"
2852	"      considerable finesse. An ordinary schemer would have been content"
2852	"      to work with a savage hound. The use of artificial means to make"
2852	"      the creature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his part. The"
2852	"      dog he bought in London from Ross and Mangles, the dealers in"
2852	"      Fulham Road. It was the strongest and most savage in their"
2852	"      possession. He brought it down by the North Devon line and walked"
2852	"      a great distance over the moor so as to get it home without"
2852	"      exciting any remarks. He had already on his insect hunts learned"
2852	"      to penetrate the Grimpen Mire, and so had found a safe"
2852	"      hiding-place for the creature. Here he kennelled it and waited"
2852	"      his chance."
2852	""
2852	"      “But it was some time coming. The old gentleman could not be"
2852	"      decoyed outside of his grounds at night. Several times Stapleton"
2852	"      lurked about with his hound, but without avail. It was during"
2852	"      these fruitless quests that he, or rather his ally, was seen by"
2852	"      peasants, and that the legend of the demon dog received a new"
2852	"      confirmation. He had hoped that his wife might lure Sir Charles"
2852	"      to his ruin, but here she proved unexpectedly independent. She"
2852	"      would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a"
2852	"      sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy."
2852	"      Threats and even, I am sorry to say, blows refused to move her."
2852	"      She would have nothing to do with it, and for a time Stapleton"

2852	"      minister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman,"
2852	"      Mrs. Laura Lyons. By representing himself as a single man he"
2852	"      acquired complete influence over her, and he gave her to"
2852	"      understand that in the event of her obtaining a divorce from her"
2852	"      husband he would marry her. His plans were suddenly brought to a"
2852	"      head by his knowledge that Sir Charles was about to leave the"
2852	"      Hall on the advice of Dr. Mortimer, with whose opinion he himself"
2852	"      pretended to coincide. He must act at once, or his victim might"
2852	"      get beyond his power. He therefore put pressure upon Mrs. Lyons"
2852	"      to write this letter, imploring the old man to give her an"
2852	"      interview on the evening before his departure for London. He"
2852	"      then, by a specious argument, prevented her from going, and so"
2852	"      had the chance for which he had waited."
2852	""
2852	"      “Driving back in the evening from Coombe Tracey he was in time to"

2852	"      the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect that"
2852	"      he would find the old gentleman waiting. The dog, incited by its"
2852	"      master, sprang over the wicket-gate and pursued the unfortunate"
2852	"      baronet, who fled screaming down the yew alley. In that gloomy"
2852	"      tunnel it must indeed have been a dreadful sight to see that huge"
2852	"      black creature, with its flaming jaws and blazing eyes, bounding"
2852	"      after its victim. He fell dead at the end of the alley from heart"
2852	"      disease and terror. The hound had kept upon the grassy border"
2852	"      while the baronet had run down the path, so that no track but the"
2852	"      man’s was visible. On seeing him lying still the creature had"
2852	"      probably approached to sniff at him, but finding him dead had"
2852	"      turned away again. It was then that it left the print which was"
2852	"      actually observed by Dr. Mortimer. The hound was called off and"
2852	"      hurried away to its lair in the Grimpen Mire, and a mystery was"

2852	"      the devilish cunning of it, for really it would be almost"
2852	"      impossible to make a case against the real murderer. His only"
2852	"      accomplice was one who could never give him away, and the"
2852	"      grotesque, inconceivable nature of the device only served to make"
2852	"      it more effective. Both of the women concerned in the case, Mrs."
2852	"      Stapleton and Mrs. Laura Lyons, were left with a strong suspicion"
2852	"      against Stapleton. Mrs. Stapleton knew that he had designs upon"
2852	"      the old man, and also of the existence of the hound. Mrs. Lyons"
2852	"      knew neither of these things, but had been impressed by the death"
2852	"      occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was"
2852	"      only known to him. However, both of them were under his"
2852	"      influence, and he had nothing to fear from them. The first half"
2852	"      of his task was successfully accomplished but the more difficult"
2852	"      still remained."
2852	""
2852	"      “It is possible that Stapleton did not know of the existence of"
2852	"      an heir in Canada. In any case he would very soon learn it from"
2852	"      his friend Dr. Mortimer, and he was told by the latter all"
2852	"      details about the arrival of Henry Baskerville. Stapleton’s first"
2852	"      idea was that this young stranger from Canada might possibly be"
2852	"      done to death in London without coming down to Devonshire at all."
2852	"      He distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in"
2852	"      laying a trap for the old man, and he dared not leave her long"
2852	"      out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her."
2852	"      It was for this reason that he took her to London with him. They"
2852	"      lodged, I find, at the Mexborough Private Hotel, in Craven"
2852	"      Street, which was actually one of those called upon by my agent"
2852	"      in search of evidence. Here he kept his wife imprisoned in her"
2852	"      room while he, disguised in a beard, followed Dr. Mortimer to"
2852	"      Baker Street and afterwards to the station and to the"
2852	"      Northumberland Hotel. His wife had some inkling of his plans; but"
2852	"      she had such a fear of her husband—a fear founded upon brutal"
2852	"      ill-treatment—that she dare not write to warn the man whom she"
2852	"      knew to be in danger. If the letter should fall into Stapleton’s"
2852	"      hands her own life would not be safe. Eventually, as we know, she"
2852	"      adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form"
2852	"      the message, and addressing the letter in a disguised hand. It"
2852	"      reached the baronet, and gave him the first warning of his"
2852	"      danger."
2852	""
2852	"      “It was very essential for Stapleton to get some article of Sir"
2852	"      Henry’s attire so that, in case he was driven to use the dog, he"
2852	"      might always have the means of setting him upon his track. With"
2852	"      characteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once,"
2852	"      and we cannot doubt that the boots or chamber-maid of the hotel"
2852	"      was well bribed to help him in his design. By chance, however,"
2852	"      the first boot which was procured for him was a new one and,"
2852	"      therefore, useless for his purpose. He then had it returned and"
2852	"      obtained another—a most instructive incident, since it proved"
2852	"      conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound,"
2852	"      as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an"
2852	"      old boot and this indifference to a new one. The more _outré_ and"
2852	"      grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be"
2852	"      examined, and the very point which appears to complicate a case"
2852	"      is, when duly considered and scientifically handled, the one"
2852	"      which is most likely to elucidate it."
2852	""
2852	"      “Then we had the visit from our friends next morning, shadowed"
2852	"      always by Stapleton in the cab. From his knowledge of our rooms"
2852	"      and of my appearance, as well as from his general conduct, I am"
2852	"      inclined to think that Stapleton’s career of crime has been by no"
2852	"      means limited to this single Baskerville affair. It is suggestive"
2852	"      that during the last three years there have been four"
2852	"      considerable burglaries in the west country, for none of which"
2852	"      was any criminal ever arrested. The last of these, at Folkestone"
2852	"      Court, in May, was remarkable for the cold-blooded pistolling of"
2852	"      the page, who surprised the masked and solitary burglar. I cannot"
2852	"      doubt that Stapleton recruited his waning resources in this"
2852	"      fashion, and that for years he has been a desperate and dangerous"
2852	"      man."
2852	""
2852	"      “We had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when"
2852	"      he got away from us so successfully, and also of his audacity in"
2852	"      sending back my own name to me through the cabman. From that"
2852	"      moment he understood that I had taken over the case in London,"
2852	"      and that therefore there was no chance for him there. He returned"
2852	"      to Dartmoor and awaited the arrival of the baronet.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “One moment!” said I. “You have, no doubt, described the sequence"
2852	"      of events correctly, but there is one point which you have left"
2852	"      unexplained. What became of the hound when its master was in"
2852	"      London?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “I have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedly"
2852	"      of importance. There can be no question that Stapleton had a"
2852	"      confidant, though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in"
2852	"      his power by sharing all his plans with him. There was an old"
2852	"      manservant at Merripit House, whose name was Anthony. His"
2852	"      connection with the Stapletons can be traced for several years,"
2852	"      as far back as the school-mastering days, so that he must have"
2852	"      been aware that his master and mistress were really husband and"
2852	"      wife. This man has disappeared and has escaped from the country."
2852	"      It is suggestive that Anthony is not a common name in England,"
2852	"      while Antonio is so in all Spanish or Spanish-American countries."
2852	"      The man, like Mrs. Stapleton herself, spoke good English, but"
2852	"      with a curious lisping accent. I have myself seen this old man"
2852	"      cross the Grimpen Mire by the path which Stapleton had marked"
2852	"      out. It is very probable, therefore, that in the absence of his"
2852	"      master it was he who cared for the hound, though he may never"
2852	"      have known the purpose for which the beast was used."
2852	""
2852	"      “The Stapletons then went down to Devonshire, whither they were"
2852	"      soon followed by Sir Henry and you. One word now as to how I"
2852	"      stood myself at that time. It may possibly recur to your memory"
2852	"      that when I examined the paper upon which the printed words were"
2852	"      fastened I made a close inspection for the water-mark. In doing"
2852	"      so I held it within a few inches of my eyes, and was conscious of"
2852	"      a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine. There are"
2852	"      seventy-five perfumes, which it is very necessary that a criminal"
2852	"      expert should be able to distinguish from each other, and cases"
2852	"      have more than once within my own experience depended upon their"
2852	"      prompt recognition. The scent suggested the presence of a lady,"
2852	"      and already my thoughts began to turn towards the Stapletons."
2852	"      Thus I had made certain of the hound, and had guessed at the"
2852	"      criminal before ever we went to the west country."
2852	""
2852	"      “It was my game to watch Stapleton. It was evident, however, that"
2852	"      I could not do this if I were with you, since he would be keenly"
2852	"      on his guard. I deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included,"
2852	"      and I came down secretly when I was supposed to be in London. My"
2852	"      hardships were not so great as you imagined, though such trifling"
2852	"      details must never interfere with the investigation of a case. I"
2852	"      stayed for the most part at Coombe Tracey, and only used the hut"
2852	"      upon the moor when it was necessary to be near the scene of"
2852	"      action. Cartwright had come down with me, and in his disguise as"
2852	"      a country boy he was of great assistance to me. I was dependent"
2852	"      upon him for food and clean linen. When I was watching Stapleton,"
2852	"      Cartwright was frequently watching you, so that I was able to"
2852	"      keep my hand upon all the strings."
2852	""
2852	"      “I have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly,"
2852	"      being forwarded instantly from Baker Street to Coombe Tracey."
2852	"      They were of great service to me, and especially that one"
2852	"      incidentally truthful piece of biography of Stapleton’s. I was"
2852	"      able to establish the identity of the man and the woman and knew"
2852	"      at last exactly how I stood. The case had been considerably"
2852	"      complicated through the incident of the escaped convict and the"
2852	"      relations between him and the Barrymores. This also you cleared"
2852	"      up in a very effective way, though I had already come to the same"
2852	"      conclusions from my own observations."
2852	""
2852	"      “By the time that you discovered me upon the moor I had a"
2852	"      complete knowledge of the whole business, but I had not a case"
2852	"      which could go to a jury. Even Stapleton’s attempt upon Sir Henry"
2852	"      that night which ended in the death of the unfortunate convict"
2852	"      did not help us much in proving murder against our man. There"
2852	"      seemed to be no alternative but to catch him red-handed, and to"
2852	"      do so we had to use Sir Henry, alone and apparently unprotected,"
2852	"      as a bait. We did so, and at the cost of a severe shock to our"
2852	"      client we succeeded in completing our case and driving Stapleton"
2852	"      to his destruction. That Sir Henry should have been exposed to"
2852	"      this is, I must confess, a reproach to my management of the case,"
2852	"      but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing"
2852	"      spectacle which the beast presented, nor could we predict the fog"
2852	"      which enabled him to burst upon us at such short notice. We"
2852	"      succeeded in our object at a cost which both the specialist and"
2852	"      Dr. Mortimer assure me will be a temporary one. A long journey"
2852	"      may enable our friend to recover not only from his shattered"
2852	"      nerves but also from his wounded feelings. His love for the lady"
2852	"      was deep and sincere, and to him the saddest part of all this"
2852	"      black business was that he should have been deceived by her."
2852	""
2852	"      “It only remains to indicate the part which she had played"
2852	"      throughout. There can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised an"
2852	"      influence over her which may have been love or may have been"
2852	"      fear, or very possibly both, since they are by no means"
2852	"      incompatible emotions. It was, at least, absolutely effective. At"
2852	"      his command she consented to pass as his sister, though he found"
2852	"      the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make her"
2852	"      the direct accessory to murder. She was ready to warn Sir Henry"
2852	"      so far as she could without implicating her husband, and again"
2852	"      and again she tried to do so. Stapleton himself seems to have"
2852	"      been capable of jealousy, and when he saw the baronet paying"
2852	"      court to the lady, even though it was part of his own plan, still"
2852	"      he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst which"
2852	"      revealed the fiery soul which his self-contained manner so"
2852	"      cleverly concealed. By encouraging the intimacy he made it"
2852	"      certain that Sir Henry would frequently come to Merripit House"
2852	"      and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he"
2852	"      desired. On the day of the crisis, however, his wife turned"
2852	"      suddenly against him. She had learned something of the death of"
2852	"      the convict, and she knew that the hound was being kept in the"
2852	"      outhouse on the evening that Sir Henry was coming to dinner. She"
2852	"      taxed her husband with his intended crime, and a furious scene"
2852	"      followed in which he showed her for the first time that she had a"
2852	"      rival in his love. Her fidelity turned in an instant to bitter"
2852	"      hatred, and he saw that she would betray him. He tied her up,"
2852	"      therefore, that she might have no chance of warning Sir Henry,"
2852	"      and he hoped, no doubt, that when the whole countryside put down"
2852	"      the baronet’s death to the curse of his family, as they certainly"
2852	"      would do, he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished"
2852	"      fact and to keep silent upon what she knew. In this I fancy that"
2852	"      in any case he made a miscalculation, and that, if we had not"
2852	"      been there, his doom would none the less have been sealed. A"
2852	"      woman of Spanish blood does not condone such an injury so"
2852	"      lightly. And now, my dear Watson, without referring to my notes,"
2852	"      I cannot give you a more detailed account of this curious case. I"
2852	"      do not know that anything essential has been left unexplained.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “He could not hope to frighten Sir Henry to death as he had done"
2852	"      the old uncle with his bogie hound.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “The beast was savage and half-starved. If its appearance did not"
2852	"      frighten its victim to death, at least it would paralyze the"
2852	"      resistance which might be offered.”"
2852	""
2852	"      “No doubt. There only remains one difficulty. If Stapleton came"
2852	"      into the succession, how could he explain the fact that he, the"
2852	"      heir, had been living unannounced under another name so close to"
2852	"      the property? How could he claim it without causing suspicion and"
2852	"      inquiry?”"
2852	""
2852	"      “It is a formidable difficulty, and I fear that you ask too much"
2852	"      when you expect me to solve it. The past and the present are"
2852	"      within the field of my inquiry, but what a man may do in the"
2852	"      future is a hard question to answer. Mrs. Stapleton has heard her"
2852	"      husband discuss the problem on several occasions. There were"
2852	"      three possible courses. He might claim the property from South"
2852	"      America, establish his identity before the British authorities"
2852	"      there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to England at"
2852	"      all, or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short"
2852	"      time that he need be in London; or, again, he might furnish an"
2852	"      accomplice with the proofs and papers, putting him in as heir,"
2852	"      and retaining a claim upon some proportion of his income. We"
2852	"      cannot doubt from what we know of him that he would have found"
2852	"      some way out of the difficulty. And now, my dear Watson, we have"
2852	"      had some weeks of severe work, and for one evening, I think, we"
2852	"      may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels. I have a box"
2852	"      for _Les Huguenots_. Have you heard the De Reszkes? Might I"
2852	"      trouble you then to be ready in half an hour, and we can stop at"
2852	"      Marcini’s for a little dinner on the way?”"
2852	""
2852	""
2852	"THE END"
